1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,960
In this video, we want to talk about the 12 principles of animation and understand how to make our

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,020
animation or motion graphics more beautiful.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,620
These principles are introduced by the two best Disney animators, meaning Oli Johnson and Frank Thomas,

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,520
for creating a beautiful and smooth motion graphic.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,280
You should first know these principles, and then with practicing a lot, you can use them in your motion

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,150
graphics.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,740
The first principle is a scratch and stretch, meaning you should stretch and scratch your objects relatively

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,070
the speed movement and weight of your object.

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,320
In this example, as you can see, the ball has a scratch and a stretch.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,580
When it's falling, it stretches and when it smashes the ground it is crashes and eventually it gets

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,410
back to its first shape.

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,970
But in this one, the ball doesn't scratch and stretch anymore.

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,150
As you can see, squashing and stretching are very effective in making our animation beautiful.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:13,070
This technique can be used in simple objects like these balls and complicated objects like the characters

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,680
movements and the characters face.

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,580
As you can see, character stretches when it's falling and when it is ready to jump splashes.

17
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,300
In this sample for looking better When the character's eye closes, the head squashes, and when the

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,430
eye starts to open up, the head stretches.

19
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,990
The important point this principle is the volume of the object should be always constant, meaning when

20
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,950
the object squashes, it should get broad and wide, and when it stretches it should get thin and slim.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,000
Sometimes for looking at animation more appealing, we can do this stretching and squashing with exaggeration

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,820
and don't observe the proportion of the volume.

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,860
As you can see in these samples.

24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,100
The second principle is anticipation, meaning before our character does.

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,260
The main move shows some movements to prepares the audience for the main move.

26
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,540
For example, here the character is doing a half leap, which is an anticipation, and it wants to show

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,020
the audience that it is going to jump.

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,650
When an animation has an anticipation, it looks more real because in reality, when someone wants to

29
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,190
jump, if he doesn't get ready for a jump and doesn't squeeze and can stretch this body, he can't jump.

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,570
So it's better than if you want your animations to look more realistic.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,430
You use this principle.

32
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,950
This is an animation with anticipation.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,810
And this one is without anticipation.

34
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,980
And as you can see, the left one is much more beautiful and realistic.

35
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,730
Let's see some more samples about anticipation in motion graphics In this sample, the character before

36
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,350
exiting the scene and going down shows anticipation and moves itself up a little bit and moves his hands

37
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,650
up.

38
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,070
So gets the audience ready for its exit of the scene.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,570
And in the next example, as you can see, the rabbit for showing an anticipation before any reaction,

40
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,230
its head and body moves down and its knees bend.

41
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,490
So it gets ready our audience for the reaction it is going to do.

42
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,830
And as you can see, it is really effective.

43
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,510
And the animations beauty.

44
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,570
The third principle is staging, meaning that you should show the activities in your scene in a way

45
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,920
that your main idea can be fully understood by the audience.

46
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,710
In other words, staging meaning is the ability to control the viewer's attention with this principle.

47
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,880
We show to our viewers what elements are the main ones, what happened and what is going to happen.

48
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,680
We shouldn't confuse the viewer with continuous and irregular happenings.

49
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,790
We have to show only one happening in one movement so the viewer understands where to look and finds

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,260
out the main idea.

51
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,130
For these.

52
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,700
The main activities should happen by the turn and with a little pause so that a special moment can be

53
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,010
shown important.

54
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,280
And for showing the main objects, we can discriminate them by light size or the details we create for

55
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,870
them.

56
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Let's see the main activities in this example.

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,400
The character first says Hello.

58
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,400
The laptop appears, which is connected to wi fi.

59
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,300
Then the TV which is connected to wi fi to comes into the scene, then character notices its phone and

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,440
its last activity is connecting to the internet by the mobile.

61
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,390
As it is completely obvious.

62
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,240
The main idea of the clip is that we can connect wi fi with different devices.

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,670
Try to keep your scene not too crowded and messy unless this is your main idea and you want to confuse

64
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,540
the viewer.

65
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,150
You should pay attention to this fact that in crowded scenes you shouldn't show all of the objects in

66
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,010
one moment because it is so hard for the viewer to focus on your animation.

67
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,430
Always calm your elements to the scene with delay or random so the viewer doesn't get confused.

68
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,560
The fourth principle is straight ahead and post to post animation.

69
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,170
In fact, this principle expresses two ways for designing an animation.

70
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,930
The first way straight ahead means that we can design the animation frame by frame from the start till

71
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,670
the end.

72
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,150
Which usually is really useful for estimating fire and water.

73
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,820
But using it in character.

74
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:04,150
Animation is really hard and complicated, especially when you are not aware of things that are going

75
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,050
to happen.

76
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,260
But the second way is posed to pose, which in this method, first the key poses are designed and then

77
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,610
the in between them.

78
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,340
And then you can design the easing process.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,120
This method is better for complicated animation because you can have a general overview of the things

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,620
that are going to happen.

81
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,950
We will have a lot to do with this method post to pose, especially when we get to character animation

82
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,730
and creating a walk cycle or run cycle animation.

83
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,020
Let's see some samples of its usage in motion graphics.

84
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,240
As you can see in these examples.

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,670
Motion Designer for reaching the main idea of his animation and what he has in mind.

86
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:54,720
First, he creates key poses by sketching and creates an elementary animation of what is going to happen

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,220
at the end and then starts to finalizing the animation.

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,620
The next principle is follow through or overlapping.

89
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,220
This technique helps a lot.

90
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:14,220
Showing the object's movements more real follow through means that the secondary or appendix objects,

91
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,720
even after the main object is stopped from moving, should keep moving.

92
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,400
Overlapping means parts of the main object react with a delay and different speed from the main object

93
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,960
and stay behind.

94
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,390
Like these samples.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,030
Appendix objects should keep moving after the main object stops and move at different times.

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,250
This principle is also used for showing a live objects and objects that are not moving like clothes

97
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,180
and hairs.

98
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,730
As you can see, this principle causes our animation to look more real and natural.

99
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,240
So certainly use it in creating your animations.

100
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:04,230
The next principle is easy in and easy out, which is the most important principle in animation.

101
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,350
Most activities that happen in our lives follow this principle.

102
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:16,420
Every object needs time to accelerate for reaching to its top speed and also when it wants to reach

103
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,550
the lowest speed from the high speed.

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,920
This should happen little by little.

105
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:30,070
In frame by frame animation, you should design more frames in the first and last parts of your animation,

106
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,120
so its start and finish moves are smooth and real.

107
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,830
More beginners mistake is that they use linear keyframes, which causes their animation to be very artificial

108
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,820
and rough.

109
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,300
Smooth animations are much better.

110
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:53,770
Elements appear at different times and they have a smooth first and end, which you can do this by smoothing

111
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,740
the graphs and the first and last parts.

112
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,730
Absolutely.

113
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,370
This doesn't mean that we shouldn't use linear keyframes at all, but we should know that most of the

114
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,650
time smoothing the key frames causes beauty.

115
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,030
You should know that every key frame kind is related to a particular position which you can get to know

116
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,490
them by experience.

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,440
The next point that you should know is sometimes you don't have only one object, but you have a few

118
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,990
objects that should be animated continuously, like animate awards letters.

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,980
Besides using the letters animation, the general animation of the world has got to be easing too.

120
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,640
So appearing the letters don't happen in turn and doesn't create a linear and boring state.

121
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,730
But the general animation of the words should start smooth and then it starts to accelerate and at the

122
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,870
end it finishes slow and the words animation should be overlap.

123
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,370
This act always makes your animation cool and interesting.

124
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,770
The next principle is arc.

125
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,880
Most movements in the real world follow a curve.

126
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,370
If we want our animation to be natural and beautiful, we should follow this rule.

127
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,250
This rule can be used for characters, parts and also for simple objects.

128
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,520
As you can see in this example, the movements of the characters body parts follow the arcs, which

129
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,360
absolutely in the walk and run cycles lesson we get to know with this concept practically should obey

130
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,410
this rule in head.

131
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,250
Turning to as you can see, if you don't follow this rule, how much our animation looks artificial

132
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,370
and boring, but when the head animation is done with arcs looks much better and beautiful.

133
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,680
This is an example of objects that are following the arcs.

134
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Our truly is that in fast movements and machine movements, we should use straighter pathways and in

135
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,440
slower movements or normal movements, we should use more bent curves.

136
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,770
As you can see in the left example, because this clip's animation is speed is normal.

137
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,960
Bends, curves have been used.

138
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,320
And in the right one because it has fast speed.

139
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,020
The straight curves have been used.

140
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,790
The next principle is secondary action.

141
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,050
This principle expresses movements and details which causes us to know more things about our character.

142
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:36,460
For example, the secondary action of the left hand shows the character's state if his hand is fist

143
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,150
mode.

144
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,830
It shows that our character is angry.

145
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,500
If it is like this.

146
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,330
It shows his happiness.

147
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:51,010
If his hand is in the front and close to its body and he looks around, it shows that he is hiding something

148
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,230
and he knocks on the door secretly.

149
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,260
The movements we can add in this principle are so personalized, meaning my secondary action may be

150
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,140
different from yours, and for adding secondary action, the only thing you should do is asking yourself,

151
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,110
Well, what other thing can I add to it?

152
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,460
Sometimes adding some details to our animation can make our animation more alive.

153
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,380
Absolutely.

154
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,050
You should consider that these movements shouldn't distract our viewers mind from the main move.

155
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,780
Well, let's go and see their usage in motion graphics.

156
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,090
Look at this sample.

157
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:31,090
The main movie is that the female character wants to throw her opponents chess piece, but when she

158
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,270
wants to do it, her facial expression changes, which can express pride and arrogance feeling to the

159
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,830
viewers and her hand state when she wants to pick up the chess piece and move it.

160
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,120
She can express her arrogance feelings so beautifully.

161
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,510
In the next example, when the boy character wants to eat something looks around in a special way which

162
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,460
can show the viewer that he's doing something secretly.

163
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,850
In the next example, a character is doing her routine activities that we're taking a deep breath.

164
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,180
She expresses that her routine activities are so boring too.

165
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,520
The next principle is timing.

166
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:17,100
It means that animation's identity depends on the number of frames that have been designed for an activity.

167
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,770
That means the more the number of frame is, the speed of that activity slows down and the less number

168
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,980
of frames means the speed will be more from the physical aspect.

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,810
Every object has a different volume, weight and condition, which here means every object needs different

170
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,800
times for doing a particular activity.

171
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:45,040
So in the places that are necessary to show the characters speed and agility, we should use fewer frames.

172
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,320
And in places we want to show the details better.

173
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,020
Animation has a higher speed automatically.

174
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,500
Like this example, we should use more frames.

175
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,000
The 10th principle is exaggeration.

176
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,140
This principle means that every activity can go a level higher, so its impact on the viewer increases.

177
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,350
Because when we want to animate our animation like the real world, it's going to be an ordinary process

178
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,910
that can be so boring.

179
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,660
So the purpose of this principle is looking at animations more appealing by doing exaggeration in them.

180
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,780
For example, if the character is sad, we make it sadder, and if it's happy, we make it look happier.

181
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,090
If it's for it, we make him look more worried.

182
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,310
If it's confused, we make it look more confused.

183
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,400
So it shows its condition more obvious.

184
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,090
The important point that you should know, the exaggerated range in line exaggeration doesn't mean to

185
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,480
make our character bend and deform, but it means to make our animation more believable and effective.

186
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,320
Let's see two samples of this principle in motion graphics.

187
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:03,650
As you can see, the left sample shows a character who is going to pull the dark color.

188
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:10,250
But the animator has done this work a level higher and he has exaggerated so beautifully.

189
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,790
Like And the other side of the color a champion is pulling the rope, which has caused this elongation

190
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,790
and at the end a rupture of the rope and then the character gets thrown to the back.

191
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,820
If the animator wanted to show this happening natural or real, and what happens in the real world,

192
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,440
how boring it was.

193
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,780
But now that there is an exaggeration, you can see how appealing it is.

194
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,950
The right sample is a fantasy sample that shows a playful square that comes into the scene and bothers

195
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,780
the circle on the water.

196
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,530
And the circle doesn't do an ordinary thing for the retaliation, like throwing this square away.

197
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:58,220
But it takes that job to the next level and swallows the square, which is an appealing exaggeration.

198
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,450
The next principle is solid drawing.

199
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,250
This principle is more related to animation designers and is very close.

200
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,010
The frame by frame or 3D design.

201
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,080
And this means the form you create.

202
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,850
It should look like that is placed in a 3D environment, meaning the character should have the right

203
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,100
amount of volume and weight in different angles.

204
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,290
Animators should be very experienced and expand because they should know 3D Designing Perspective principles,

205
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,710
anatomy and different poses of a character.

206
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,020
And the last principle is appeal.

207
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,850
This principle is more related to the characters designer, and its meaning is that character should

208
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,630
be attractive and can get communicated with the viewer.

209
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,540
It is not necessarily needed that this principle should be considered for the champion character, but

210
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,840
it can be a monster, a villain or a diagram for making characters more attractive.

211
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,870
You can use dynamic designs and there are three methods for making designs dynamic.

212
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,870
The first way is to use different shapes for designing the characters.

213
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,410
Instead of using one shape for all of the characters.

214
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,200
Use different shapes.

215
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,570
The second way is to play with proportions.

216
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:22,580
In this way you can find every character's index and exaggerate it to reach a more attractive design.

217
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,600
Thirdly, you should keep your designing simple because this character should animate in too much detail.

218
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,780
Besides that, it is confusing.

219
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,040
It will ruin the animation to.

220
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,820
Well, 12 principles of animation are done.

221
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,640
And if you want to use these 12 principles in your animations and motion graphics, try to review these

222
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,150
principles before every animation you're going to make, use them in your animations.

223
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,550
So after high repetition, you can involuntary use them in your animations without paying attention

224
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,960
to these principles.

225
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,400
Good luck.
