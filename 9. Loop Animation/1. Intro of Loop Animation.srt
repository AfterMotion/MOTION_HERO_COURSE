Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,440
In this video, I want to talk about loop animations.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,980
The first thing I should know is what is loop and what kind of clips I call loop.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,390
In general, I call a few seconds clip loop videos because they repeat and less times and I can't easily

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,680
decide which part is the first and last part.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,030
I think that they are long clips, but that is not true.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,400
At first.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,470
Let me say a few points about loop animations.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,740
So further I use them in a project.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,360
The first point I want to say is that try to make your loop animation as simple as possible as it shows

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,500
only acts of one thing like eating, walking or etc..

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,680
Not that we use several acts in one loop animation because in this condition it's better that we call

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,590
it the short film rather than loop animation.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,670
Maybe now you are thinking that the loop animation that only shows one act is not that interesting,

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,490
but as you can see, it is not like that.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,230
Only with adding details and more elements to the animation we can create.

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,780
Simple yet really interesting clips.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,400
The second point, I should say, is that we should try to make our scenes as dynamic as possible.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,370
It should always have movements.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,320
There should be no objects to be in your scene.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,180
On the contrary, everything should be moving in your loop animation.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,870
Why?

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,750
Because the scene is going to be repeated a lot of times for your audience.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,420
That is why it should be as dynamic and interesting as possible.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,270
The next point that should be considered in loop animations and has a lot of influence in making our

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,300
animation interesting is overlapping.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,310
Overlapping makes your animation more smooth and natural and makes it more realistic.

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,680
The next and most important point about loop animations and generally in all of the animations is smoothing

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,990
keyframes and path animations.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:14,080
So use as much as possible from easiest keyframes and don't use linear keyframes as much as possible.

31
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,280
Because naturally when you use these keyframes, you will have smooth and more interesting animations.

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,550
The last point, I should say, is timing, which you should pay attention to it from the beginning

33
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,730
of making your loop animation so that the time of your whole animation should be matched with the time

34
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,380
of the objects loop.

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,910
For example, if our whole animation loop time is 30 frames, the object's time multiple in the scene

36
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,590
should be a 32.

37
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,710
It means that if, for example, an object is looping in a scene, its loop time should be either five

38
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,100
frames or six, ten, 15 or 30.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,260
So it matches with a whole loop animation time, which is 30 frames.

40
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,370
So this way we don't have any kind of leap in our loop animation.

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,760
The next point about timing, which sometimes happen, is all of the loops in a scene and in the same

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,420
frame.

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,420
For example, we have a few characters walking and a first and last part of their walking, and in the

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,710
same frame you are walking exactly at the same time and it creates a robotic and artificial state.

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,920
In these situations, with a little bit of moving and overlapping the key frames of the loop, we get

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,520
better results and make the scene look more natural.

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,080
When we can consider and use these points in our loop animations.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,320
You can see we have made more interesting loop animations which have unclear first and last part, meaning

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,520
we have no leaps in our loops and eventually attracts the audience so audiences can watch over and over

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,350
and doesn't get tired of it.

51
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,980
So in the next lesson, I start to make a simple loop animation considering points we just talked about.

52
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,390
Good luck.
