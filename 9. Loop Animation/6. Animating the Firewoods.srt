1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,540
For creating the file with animation, I should create two new shapes.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,030
I create a rectangle here.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,150
And said it's colored the same as the trunks color.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,330
I name it our timber.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,730
I want to animate this layer for this IP position and rotation.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,540
Exactly in a frame.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,260
My character's ax placed on the trunk.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,600
I put the first keyframe here.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,830
I go nine frames ahead and I place my layer here and a little bit higher.

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,270
I adjust its path?

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,660
Well, it's good.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,700
I go six frames ahead and put the layer here.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
It should almost place here.

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,760
I go eight frames ahead and I put the layer here again, five frames ahead, and I put it here.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,510
Here.

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,720
The Y position is on 924.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,670
And here should be 924 to.

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,810
Because the ground is the same.

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,740
Again, I go seven frames ahead and put it here.

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,950
Let me change these a little bit.

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,580
And I continue to do the same.

22
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,170
After I'm done, I select the pencil and edit the upper points handles.

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,450
I select the keyframes which my object places on top and make them easy ease.

24
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,010
I limit the work area to see how it looks.

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,440
Well, as you can see, when my object is in these places pauses a little bit.

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
And this is not right.

27
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,880
For removing this problem.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,970
I select the key frame and go into graph editor.

29
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,140
Right click on them and go into keyframe velocity.

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,880
I turn on the continue so I can move the keyframes together.

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,130
I move them a little bit higher so its speed doesn't get to zero in this point.

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,420
Let's take a look.

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,260
Well, it's good after that in places in the firewood is on the ground.

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,710
I want its rotation to be like this.

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,020
And when it places here, I want it like this.

36
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,610
And at the end it should rotate and plays like this.

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's take a look.

38
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,250
Well, it's good.

39
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,250
I want my firewood to have a burning stay.

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,770
That is why I add band effect to it.

41
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,110
Let me follow the ledger.

42
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,800
When it is here, I set the start and end points.

43
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,470
I increase the band a little bit and set the start point in the middle.

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,460
I move this higher so I can have this kind of shape.

45
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,260
Now I want that when the object moves, these points move with it to.

46
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,790
For this, I hit all click on a start and type the two command and type value and it.

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,530
And I copy this expression four and two.

48
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,050
And at the end I put the endpoint here and they start in the center of my object.

49
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,340
After that, I create a keyframe for each band in here and set it on zero.

50
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,850
I hit you key.

51
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,240
When my object is here, I want it to bend to the side.

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,320
-20.

53
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,210
When it is here, it should be on 20.

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,480
And here again, -20.

55
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,040
Let's take a look.

56
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,080
In my opinion, -20 is too much.

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,860
I change it to minus ten.

58
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,530
Yes, that's better.

59
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,420
This one on ten.

60
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,690
And here on minus ten.

61
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,630
Well, it's much better.

62
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,900
In fact, this is my left Firebird Slayer.

63
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,840
I rename it to L Timber.

64
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,430
I go into it.

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,300
I duplicate the rectangle.

66
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,820
And its color should be the same as the inner color of the trunk.

67
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,920
And in here change the size of the rectangle path.

68
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,150
So it looks like the left piece of the Firebird.

69
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,170
After that I duplicate the layer.

70
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,420
Name it to write.

71
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,810
I come at the beginning of the animation, I should pattern this layer to another object.

72
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,900
I put the null object exactly in its center.

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,190
And apparent derision to the nul objects.

74
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,920
Then I select three horizontal for this layer and let this null.

75
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,470
So this layer moves to the side.

76
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,740
Well, as you can see, it moves through this side.

77
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,950
Now, I don't need the upper rectangle because I want to be the right piece of my firewood.

78
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,510
And another point is here the band direction should be reversed to.

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,500
And eventually this left layer should be placed under the character layers.

80
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,890
Let me play the animation from the beginning.

81
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,700
After that, I should start creating shadows for the fire with pieces.

82
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,080
For this.

83
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,490
I create an ellipse here.

84
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,400
Exactly when the firewood is on the ground.

85
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,410
Make it black.

86
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,090
Move it down and place it under the L timber layer.

87
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,870
I said it's opacity on 30 and name it Shadow.

88
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,820
And I want to point out it's exposition to the exposition of my firewood layer.

89
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,560
That is why I alt click and define exposition of lhe timber layer for its ex.

90
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,150
I write a semi column and move to the next line.

91
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,860
I define what the layer is itself so it doesn't change.

92
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,050
And here I write X and Y.

93
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,600
So my expression ends.

94
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,830
Now, as you can see, the shadow moves with my object.

95
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,600
Another thing is when my object is floating in the air, the shadow should be smaller, and when it

96
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,180
is closer to the ground should be bigger.

97
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,310
For this.

98
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,810
I open this kale.

99
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,780
I activate its expression.

100
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,780
And in expressions interpolation I select the second linear.

101
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,270
I hit an answer at first.

102
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:33,650
So the linear moves to the second line and I defined the y position of Firebird layer as DT variable.

103
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:41,150
I write semi so it ends its minimum, meaning when it is here is 924.

104
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,500
And the maximum when the place top is 592.

105
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,720
And when it is on 592, I want the X and Y scale to be on 100.

106
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,790
Well, as you can see, the shadow changes as I wanted to.

107
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,570
Just let me move its x more to this side so the shadow completely fades at the end.

108
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,420
After that, I duplicate this layer and bring it up.

109
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,330
And do the same for the other five with peace.

110
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,580
I appear its position.

111
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,660
I double tap on E so I can see the expressions.

112
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,940
I defined x position of r timber as x variable the y of itself.

113
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,100
Good so far.

114
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,870
As you can see now, the shadow of the other firework piece is going to be good to.

115
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,620
Just I want the shadow layer to appear from here.

116
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,460
That is why I said it's beginning.

117
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,490
And this layer to.

118
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,890
Let's take a look at my animation.

119
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,580
Well, as you can see, my animation is completely fixed.

120
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,930
Let's get to creating a math ledger.

121
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,840
I move this above my axe layer and name it Matt.

122
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,910
I selected alpha inverted math for the axilla.

123
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,420
Yea.

124
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,960
I bring this down a little bit so the firewood can't be seen.

125
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,570
Well, let's see how my animation is.

126
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,030
Well, it's good.

127
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,810
The last thing I should do is create a motion blur state and a trace of the Axis movement.

128
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,590
As you can see in my frame, my accent moves from here till it places under trunk.

129
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,520
I want my ax to have a trace to look more interesting.

130
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,340
For this, it is enough to select the pencil and create a point here.

131
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,180
And another one here.

132
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,400
I adjust the path the way it shows the Axis movement path.

133
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,920
I disable its feel and enable a stroke.

134
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,230
It's a stroke.

135
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
Should be the same color as the axis color.

136
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,800
I increase its size, it becomes the same as the bottom part of my axis.

137
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,090
And this frame which the act places on.

138
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,500
I go to frames ahead and set the layers.

139
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,610
And here.

140
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,900
Here appears in the next frame.

141
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,730
My stroke should be half.

142
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,810
That is why I added three path modifier to the contents.

143
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,490
I said it's and on 50 and create a keyframe frame for it.

144
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,830
And in previous frame I set it on 100.

145
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,250
And eventually it fades.

146
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,630
Well, my love animation is completely finished.

147
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,170
As I said, we should first hypothesize our animation so simple.

148
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,200
And as I said, our character has two poses.

149
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,210
One of them is this and the next pose is when the ax hits the firewood.

150
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,950
And in the beginning, as we did first, we created these two simple poses.

151
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,830
And then the other details and elements of the scene have been animated in relation to these two poses.

152
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,100
Good luck.
