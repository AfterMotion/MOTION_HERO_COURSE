1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,220
The first pose I should create is my character moving a little bit to the back?

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,600
The body should rotate.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,960
And these hands should rotate.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,070
So it places like this kind of situation.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,450
And at the end I rotate the axe so it completely lies on the trunk.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,330
Well, it is good enough.

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,380
I have created the first post.

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,860
I created a key frame for the ride legs rotation.

9
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,290
Another one for the body is rotation.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,240
For the axis rotation.

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,180
And another one for this bone rotation.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,480
I should rotate the next rotation a little bit and set it on 18.

13
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,440
And the heads rotation on minus nine.

14
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
Well, I create a key frame for the head and neck to.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,480
After I have created the first post, I go to the second one and create the second post.

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,440
Well, and here the character should completely move backward.

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,770
The legs rotation comes forward.

18
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,230
I set it on for.

19
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,580
I moved the body more to behind.

20
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,050
Well, it's good.

21
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,330
I move the hand to back.

22
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,070
Rotate this.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,560
It has a bending state.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,010
I should create a keyframe for this bone, too.

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,290
And because it doesn't have any keyframes in the first post, I should move back.

26
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,910
Set this on zero and create the first post keyframe for it.

27
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,370
And the next should rotate to behind here.

28
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,690
Also for the head.

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,410
Well, it's fine.

30
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,620
I think the hands should move more to behind.

31
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,200
And here I go into the heads later.

32
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,080
I create a keyframe for the eyebrows position.

33
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,710
And as you can see, its anchor point is here.

34
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,610
And another key frame for its rotation to have this kind of animation.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:13,630
I go into the eyes shape and in the lips path I create a keyframe frame for the eye size to.

36
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,470
I hit you.

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,270
So only the keyframes would be shown here.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,090
I create a simple animate for this part of hair for now, but I should change it later.

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,550
Well, I create a keyframe for its rotation.

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,620
I move it a little bit behind.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,820
I get back to the first post.

42
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,070
Its rotation should mean this way.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,560
Here.

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,190
I create the eyebrow and I keyframes.

45
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,040
I go to the second pose and here the eyebrow should rotate like this.

46
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,890
Also a little bit slower.

47
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,040
And said the ellipses and one so I can see the pressure on my character.

48
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,650
Let's take a look at my animation.

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,850
As you can see, my animation is on loop because it has the leap.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,220
I should make it loop.

51
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,490
For this.

52
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,520
I go for frames ahead from second one and pace the first post key frames here.

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,780
For this.

54
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,410
I use this script motion to and I click on the clone.

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,110
I leave me to work here again until here so I can see how the animation is.

56
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,940
Here.

57
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,580
The ax should move a little bit backward.

58
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,420
And here it gets back to its first position.

59
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,140
Let's see how it looks.

60
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,620
Well, I select a middle key frames and easy ease of them.

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,370
As you can see, I have created a really simple loop animation, but it is so artificial I should give

62
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,990
more details to it and regulate the speed of animate so it looks better.

63
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,050
I select all of the middle key frames and set their easy ease on 100.

64
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,520
Let's take a look.

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,910
It's real bad.

66
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,810
It's too much.

67
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,830
Let me move the keyframes on second 14.

68
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,030
The animation got better in a second post.

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,910
It slows down and speeds up again.

70
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,740
I moved the key frames a few frames ahead so I can create a movement before the character's animation.

71
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,470
I go to frames backward and create keyframe for these three bones.

72
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,480
Then easy is the keyframes.

73
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,240
So I have a smooth movement at first.

74
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,350
I change keyframes so I can have this kind of state.

75
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,350
I make I make these keyframes also busier so my animate doesn't have a pause.

76
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,440
And here I move the ex lawyer and again I set these on auto busier.

77
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,860
Let's take a look.

78
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,660
I should move this up.

79
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's take a look.

80
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,680
I copy the frame and paste it here.

81
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,080
So the first and the last of my animation would be the same.

82
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,900
Well, the character animation is much better.
