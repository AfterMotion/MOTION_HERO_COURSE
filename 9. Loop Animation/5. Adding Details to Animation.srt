1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,200
They made an animation of My character is almost done, but I want my loop animation to look better.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:14,300
So I go for the details like scene details, animation layers, overlapping animation, creating a springy

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,200
animation.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
So I have a more dynamic and better animation.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,090
The head animation should begin a little sooner.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,440
And when the ax touches the trunk, I want the head to have a springy animation.

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,710
That is why I like the rotation and click on Excite.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,150
Let's have a look.

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,760
The head movement is too much.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,580
I said the overshoot and ten.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,150
And it's friction on 60, so the movement stops sooner.

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,890
And as you can see, the head gets a fancy movement.

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,010
Well, it's good.

14
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,990
After that, I go for this lecture.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,780
While the character is moving behind, this part of the hair should rotate to forward.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,020
So its rotation should be to the backwards, for example, on 23.

17
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,960
Then it comes till here and sets on zero.

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,980
And it should be easy.

19
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,820
Easy to.

20
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,280
It should get back to his place from here.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,710
Here is zero.

22
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,770
And gets down to.

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,500
You'll hear.

24
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,120
It should be on -23, meaning it should be leaning backward.

25
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,680
Go forward till the head is going back.

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,410
And here, set it on zero and make it linear.

27
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,040
And apply excite to it.

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,480
And its overseer should be ten like head.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,230
And in the beginning it should be zero.

30
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,390
Increase its overshoot so its animation becomes more obvious.

31
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,630
Well, it's good.

32
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,980
After that I go for leaves animation.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,390
When my character hits its ax and the trunk.

34
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,890
This leaves should animate and have follow through animation.

35
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,440
Well, I go for the trunk layer.

36
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,110
I go into group leaves layer leave zero one meaning this layer.

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,070
As you can see, its anchor point is here, and it should be here so I can rotate it from this part.

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,490
I create a keyframe for the rotation of Leaf zero one and another one for the Leaf zero two rotation.

39
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,940
I hate you Key.

40
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,010
I go to frames ahead.

41
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,910
I move it a little bit down so it shows the power wave when the axe hits the trunk.

42
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,340
I move this one a little bit down to and because I want the animation of these two leaves to be different,

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,570
I move the second key frame of the upper leaf, so the animation be different together.

44
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,220
I go to a frames for it and set these on zero.

45
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,290
I said the key frames differently.

46
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,870
I make their medial keyframes Easy, easy.

47
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,050
And I apply IXI to both rotations.

48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
Let's take a look.

49
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,760
I move this more to the side.

50
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,940
Let's see if it looks better.

51
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,500
Well, it's good enough.

52
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,810
Let's get to animating Delicious.

53
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,520
I should do the same for these two.

54
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,940
I appear the rotation and create a keyframe frame for them.

55
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,730
Two frames forward.

56
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,310
Bring them down a bit.

57
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,390
Again, I go to frames ahead and duplicate their first key frames.

58
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,990
I make these and easy easy to.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
And for being different, I changed the keyframes.

60
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,360
I select the two and click on Excite.

61
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,630
I can move these two through these side also for these two.

62
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,210
So its animation looks more smooth.

63
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,270
I should do the same for the two places behind.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
This time I go three frames ahead.

65
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,740
So it looks different from this.

66
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,750
I bring it down.

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,450
Again.

68
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,850
Three frames ahead.

69
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,870
I copy the first key frames.

70
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,620
Make the middle keyframes Easy.

71
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,080
Easy.

72
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,140
And make more changes in their animation.

73
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,920
I select the two rotations and click on each side so they can have a spring animation.

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,570
Led me increase this one to.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,090
Well, it's good so far.

76
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,760
I can intimate more details.

77
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,390
For example, I can create bounds for the hand sleeve.

78
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,710
And this is my slave group.

79
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,910
I go into its transform and create a keyframe for its scale.

80
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,610
I put this scale keyframe here.

81
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,540
And I want to animate it in the y axis.

82
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,560
So I go three frames ahead and set this on 105.

83
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,690
Again, three frames ahead and I paste the first key frame.

84
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,810
I easy is the middle key frame and then select scale and apply excite to it.

85
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,170
I increase its bounds a little bit.

86
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,290
Well, it's good.

87
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,240
I want to create the same bouncing for the bottom part of the character's pants, too.

88
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,510
For this, I select the pants layer.

89
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,770
I'm going to contend this part, in part.

90
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,580
As you can see, its anchor point is up here, and it should be here to.

91
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,180
I go into its shape, transform and create a keyframe for its scale.

92
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,870
I do the same for the other, like behind.

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,980
I go into content pants, too, and I create a keyframe for this scale.

94
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,280
I hit you key for this one to.

95
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,300
I select this scale keyframes and move them here, which the X places on the trunk.

96
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,550
This one to.

97
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,700
I go Three frames ahead.

98
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,530
I set the scale on 110.

99
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,930
I also do the same for this one.

100
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,580
Three frames ahead.

101
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,000
I paced the first key frames and easy is the middle key frames.

102
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,880
And I said, like this scale and apply excite to them.

103
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,820
Let's take a look.

104
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,320
I make some changes, so their animation looks different.

105
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,610
So far, my character's animation has been completed and now I should start animating splitting the

106
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,360
firewood.
