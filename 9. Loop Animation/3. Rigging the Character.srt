1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,760
The important point in the loop animations is that the first and the last frame of your animation should

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,690
be the same.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,980
So there is no jump when your animation starts replaying.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:19,180
And the main point which I mentioned in a previous video, is that you should make your loop animations

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,800
as simple as possible.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,010
Let me take a look at this animation.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,080
Well, as you can see, I have this kind of pose for my character.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,620
This is one pose for my character, and the second pose that I should create for my character is this

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,400
pose.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:50,110
In fact, I create two poses for my character or my animation, and my loop will be going in a cycle

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,850
between these two poses.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,010
Well, let's go to the job.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,270
The first pose I want to create is the pose which my character has hit with the axe and is bending.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,140
For this I should parent the layers together so I don't have any problem when I animate.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,040
As I said, this layer should be parented to the shoe layer.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,610
So I parent the right leg to the right shoe.

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,110
That is why when I animate the right leg, there is no need to animate the left leg to.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
I patterned the left leg's rotation to the right.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,930
Leg's rotation.

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,850
So when the right leg got rotated, the left leg rotates to.

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,410
So I appeared the rotation of the left leg.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,210
The right leg too.

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,990
Then I patterned the left leg's rotation to the right.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,190
Leg's rotation.

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,330
If you pay attention.

26
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:59,290
You see, when I rotate the right leg, the left leg rotates, too, and changes its value.

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,520
The next thing I should do is parenting the character's body to the leg.

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,670
It.

29
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,170
So when my character's like, rotates, the body moves to.

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,250
So I parent the body to the right leg.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,340
Well, now, if I move the right leg, the body moves to.

32
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,710
It's good so far.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,220
I should pattern the hand layer to the body.

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,030
The next should parent to the Buddy ledger.

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,620
The head lawyer should parent the next lawyer.

36
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,190
And this part of the hair layer should be parented to the head layer.

37
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,250
Let's rotate and see how it is.

38
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,510
It's good.

39
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,890
All the parts of the character move by rotating the character's leg.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Well, I should attach the ax to the character's hand so when his hands moves, he swings the ax too.

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,960
I parent a layer to my character's hand.

42
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,140
Let me rotate.

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,190
You see, when the character's hand rotates, the ax moves with it to.

44
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,400
What we need to do here is that when my character's hand moves to the back of this body, it should

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,420
be bent.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,050
I want to create this kind of shame for him.

47
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,380
I create this bending state in two ways.

48
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,590
The first one is by using banned effect.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,290
Let me add the band effect to my character's hand so you get the impression.

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,560
Well, as you can see, when I increase the band and the character's hand bands are no longer the X

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,050
moves with the hand, and this is not good.

52
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,120
Because I want the axe moving with a hand when the hand rotates and I don't want the axe left behind

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,520
from the hand so they bend.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
The fact is not useful for us.

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,940
The second and the best way that I can parent the axe to the character's hand is that I use puppets.

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,690
Let me set the hand's rotation on zero.

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,500
I activated the perpetual.

58
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:39,130
I create three pins for it, one in the shoulder, one in the elbow, and finally one to the part which

59
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,290
I want my axe to pair into.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,430
I press cancel A to select the three pin puppets and for having more control over the puppets, I should

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,730
create a null object for these puppets.

62
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,950
For creating null objects.

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,590
I can use the motion to script.

64
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,510
In this drop menu, select the PIN Plus.

65
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,410
And as you can see, three null objects have been created for us.

66
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,440
Another way you can use is you select the PIN puppets and use the free script, which is a completely

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,690
pro script for the characters.

68
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,030
I go into the rigging panel and links and constrains.

69
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,660
I click on Add Bones and it creates a three layers for your pin puppets.

70
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,020
After I created layers for the pin puppets of the character's hand, there is no need for the hand layer

71
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,990
to be parented to the body layer because I want to control the hand by these bones.

72
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,770
That's why I am apparently here.

73
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,610
They said bones should be parented to the second and second.

74
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,590
Bowen should be parented to the first one, and the first one should be parented to the body.

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,030
Now, if I rotate the body, you can see the hand rotates to.

76
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,780
And now if I parent to axe Layer to the third bone, which is this layer.

77
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,470
When the hand rotates.

78
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,460
Let me rotate The first one you see the X moves to.

79
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,290
And if I want to create a bending state for the hand.

80
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,850
I rotate the second bone a little bit, and as you can see, the hand has a bending state.

81
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,110
Very simple.

82
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,510
The axes completely parented to the hand, and it doesn't matter how much it bends.

83
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:54,980
The act is parented to the hand, and it is not like band effects and the acts doesn't leave behind.

84
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,580
Well, I said these values on zero now, which my characters can play the lyric.

85
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,020
I go to creating the first post.
