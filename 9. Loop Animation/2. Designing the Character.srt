00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,890
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,010
In this video, I want to create a simple loop so I get to know the points that I mentioned in a previous

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,300
video practically.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,420
Well, this is the plan that I want to make it a loop animation.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,060
And finally, I want to have this kind of result.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,050
Let me first explain how I can create these shapes so you don't get confused about how these shapes

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,100
have been made.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,850
It is so simple, but I will explain it to you.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,300
As you see, this is the head layer of my character, which its main shape is a rounded rectangle.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,310
I open the layer.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
This is my main shape.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,350
Then I made the main beard layer.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,650
Let me hide other layers so I can see it.

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,940
I created the main beard layer by duplicate this layer and then cut it in half.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,920
The next layer is the front part of the beer.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,620
And this is a rounded rectangle too.

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,870
The next layer is hair, which I made this part again by duplicate this layer.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,440
The next layer.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,060
Is this part of the hair?

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,310
As you can see, I created an ellipse here for my character's ear, another smaller ellipse for the

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,140
inner circle in the ear.

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,560
The next shape I made is the nose layer.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,320
I created it by pen tool.

24
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,770
Next, I created the eye layer with a small ellipse and this one by a stroke.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,740
And finally, the last layer, which is the characters scrunchy, has been made by stroke.

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,650
All of these shapes are my character's head layer.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,360
I have put this part of the hair in an individual layer and said its anchor point here, so I can make

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,250
a springy animation for it.

29
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,530
The next layer is the neck.

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,060
As you can see, it is rounded rectangle and its anchor point is here.

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,570
And the anchor point of the head layer is here.

32
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,620
Next is the buddy layer, which I named it hip.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,430
It's better to be the body.

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,170
Well, this is my buddy layer.

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,820
Let me make it slow so I can completely see how it is.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,530
I open the layer.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,260
There is a main layer which is an ellipse.

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,970
The next layer is the hip.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,710
I created a pelvis for it and next is for the color shadow.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,330
And this is the color.

41
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,940
And finally, a layer for its belt.

42
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,600
Designing this part of character is not much hard.

43
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,480
The point is that you should set the anchor point of the body here because the character's body is going

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,040
to rotate from here.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,550
Well, the next layer is the character's leg.

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,790
The main shape is a rectangle, which is the path of my character.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,580
The next layer is the bottom part of the pants, which I made with a different color.

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,680
The next shape is the leg part.

49
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,570
And finally, another layer for my character's socks.

50
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,530
The next layer is shoe, which as you can see, it is a single shape.

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,480
And has been designed like this.

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,120
And for the shoelace, I just made a path and kept its stroke.

53
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,270
And said the anchor points of layers in this part.

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,060
Maybe you wonder my legs.

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,140
Anchor point is here in the bottom part, which should be here around its pelvis.

56
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,700
This is because my character animation, as you can see here.

57
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,360
In such a way that the bottom part of the legs are still and this part of the leg should rotate from

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,870
here.

59
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,900
That is why the legs anchor point shouldn't be here in the pelvis, but it should be here in a button

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,200
so I can have this kind of rotation in the leg.

61
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,800
I should say this point that you break the character relatively to your animation and it is not like

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,160
that.

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
Characters, Rick should be the same all the time.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,700
It is different depending on a need and the movement you should make with your character.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,820
Your method is going to change.

66
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,960
Well, I duplicated the leg layers and put it behind.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,950
Let me hide them so you can completely understand.

68
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,530
I created the hand layer with a rounded rectangle, which is obvious.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,040
This is my main layer.

70
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,050
For making the hand sleeve.

71
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,690
I duplicated this rounded rectangle.

72
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,180
Let me swallow this layer.

73
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,090
This is the stroke of the character's sleeve.

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,650
And this is the sleeve itself.

75
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,720
And this is the hand.

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,450
The next layer is the ax.

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Its root is completely obvious.

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
That has been made with a rounded rectangle.

79
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,540
This is the worst part.

80
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,400
I created one rounded rectangle and here I selected these points.

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,200
And with heating control t, I made this part a little bit bigger.

82
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,970
For the iron part of the ax, I created a main shape.

83
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,200
I created this shape and then I created its edge by duplicating the shape.

84
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,660
I only kept this part of it.

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,730
And finally, I created a reflect like this.

86
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,020
Let me disable the marriage path and hide this part of X.

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,770
Let me hide these two layers so you completely understand.

88
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,370
As you can see, this is the reflect part of the ax.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,990
This is the ax shape which I have created it by duplicating this shape.

90
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,640
And then I added marriage path as modifier to its group and said its mode on intersect.

91
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,430
So it keeps the common area of these two layers and hide the rest.

92
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,950
These layers are completely obvious.

93
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,460
I created the shape here.

94
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,190
Then I created this shape.

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,130
And at the end, the two leaves and one branch here.

96
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,150
And I created this wood with two shapes.

97
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,900
After we are done with getting acquainted with these objects designing, we should go to this animation.
