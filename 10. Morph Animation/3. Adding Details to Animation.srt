00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,690
Hi.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,960
As you know, in this lesson, I want to add bouncing and anticipation for the animation, for creating

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,390
anticipation, isolate the camera layer and open its rotation.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,380
And I go seven frames backward and create a keyframe for rotation and go to the second one because the

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,370
camera rotates to the left.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,280
I want to write a little bit and say, Don't.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,890
And easy is this keyframe.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,600
I want the rotation to look better, so let me use it to an effect.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,990
I added to the layer and create a keyframe here for the angle and here seven for the five degrees.

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,810
I go three frames forward and send this to -50 degrees.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,400
And at the end on zero.

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,130
I press you so I can see the keyframes.

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
I paste this keyframe here.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,870
So it's cavernous, continuous until here.

15
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,820
Let's create the anticipation of this movement when the magnifier starts going up.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,790
I go back seven frames again?

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,720
I would say the layer to this side.

18
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,930
Isolate the two key frames and reverse them.

19
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,500
And easy is this key frame.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,020
I just the keyframes.

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,140
So the animation looks better.

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,890
I uses this key frame to.

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,230
Here.

24
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,050
The rotation of the layers should be like this.

25
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,390
And I make the keyframe continuous.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,660
Let's see how it is.

27
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,770
It's a little bit better.

28
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,770
I think its rotation for anticipation is too much, so I decrease it.

29
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,660
Now it's better.

30
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,500
I need you to see the keyframes.

31
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,790
Isolate all of the key frames belonging to the second morph.

32
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,260
Move them a little bit forward so that the animation don't overlap.

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,790
Well, it's good for now.

34
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,840
I've done the anticipation of the animation.

35
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:12,560
Let's create the bouncy animation so the animation becomes more dynamic, isolate the rotation and apply

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,140
excite.

37
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,200
So from motion to a script.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,020
And I said the overshoot to ten.

39
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,630
And the bouncing to 20.

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,180
So it's rotation and the bouncing amount gets decreased.

41
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,040
Let's see how it is.

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,600
I believe the key frame of the total effect.

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,800
So the animation looks better.

44
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,510
Let's see it again.

45
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,680
Let me move the keyframes of the second animation forward.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,460
So the bouncing of the first move becomes more obvious.

47
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,240
As you see, it, has bouncy animation and then it starts to move and the bounce effect is still on

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,020
the layer and this causes the map to have this rotation.

49
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,080
First stop in the bounce in the second move.

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,050
I go to this frame and create a keyframe for the overshoot slider.

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,990
I go to the next frame and say, one zero.

52
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,090
As you see, it doesn't bounce anymore.

53
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,540
Let's take a look and see how it is.

54
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,130
Well, it's good enough now.

55
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,960
When the locator places on the map, I want it to have a bouncy animation to.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,620
For this I open the locator layer and select these two layers relating to the locator.

57
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,590
Press control g and put them in a new group.

58
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,280
And name it Group locator.

59
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,750
I said its anchor point to the bottom.

60
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,370
I often transform and create a keyframe for its scale.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,180
I press you key when the locator is floating.

62
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,580
I put this scale keyframe here.

63
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,060
And here I create another keyframe.

64
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,180
And up to here, which is falling, is its wide scale on 110.

65
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,090
After that, isolate the scale and apply to it.

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,690
Overflowing and bouncing on 20.

67
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,110
Let's see how it is.

68
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,950
As you can see, I have created a spring animation for it, but it's not enough.

69
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,220
That's why I said this on 20.

70
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,030
Let's see if it gets better.

71
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,000
I increase the bouncing a little bit.

72
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,560
Let's see how it goes.

73
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
Its animation is good.

74
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,240
Now I want to create a bounce animation for the map scale for this isolate group map scale.

75
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,660
Go into motion to a script, then click on Excite.

76
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,220
Let's take a look.

77
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,340
As you can see, the changes I make here don't apply to the map.

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,350
Because the coding is associated with these sliders.

79
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,130
As you see, if I increase this, this one rises to.

80
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,300
One of the bikes that motion to have is this.

81
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,940
That's why I don't use motion to here.

82
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,830
I use another way for my bouncing and that is the expression.

83
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,910
I'll click on it and paste the bouncy expression in it.

84
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,420
And as you can see, I have a reasonable enough animation.

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,640
Let's see the animation from the beginning.

86
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,400
I want the second more first thoughts when the magnifier rotates up.

87
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,600
That's why I select the keyframes and move them back to this point.

88
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,970
Let's see how it is.

89
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,150
Well, it's good.

90
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,240
After that, you can add a few shapes elements at the end and make your animation more dynamic and lovely.

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,760
Creating these changes is not that hard.

92
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,540
As you can see, this is a circle that has only a stroke and with the help of pass modifier, I created

93
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,390
this kind of animation for it.

94
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,170
I have explained the way of making these shape elements in the Shapes chapter.

95
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,400
Good luck.
