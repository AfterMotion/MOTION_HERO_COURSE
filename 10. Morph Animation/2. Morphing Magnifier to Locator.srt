00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,690
Hi.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,700
In this lesson, I want more of the magnifier into the locator and the map.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,660
For this, I open the position and create a keyframe for it.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,430
And another keyframe for its rotation.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,380
I want to start morphing the magnifier to the locator.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,500
From the second to I appear the locator.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,830
When I want more of two shapes together should see what their common points can be.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:34,320
In my opinion, this wide angle in the magnifier and this wide circle in the locator can be the main

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,170
part of the morph animation, and other parts can appear based on these two objects.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,900
I want the magnifier to have a rotation and go up and fall down and be placed on the map like a locator.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,750
For this, I created a keyframe for its rotation and position in the second to go 15 frames forward,

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,710
Move the magnifier up.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,990
Benton frames forward and paced the key frames position here.

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,900
It rotates and at the end is like this 90 degrees.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,020
I iss this key frame.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,330
So I have a little pause here.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,390
Let's see how it is.

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,670
It's pause is too short.

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,260
So I go to the graph editor and increase these two handles so its pores gets longer.

20
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,850
Let's see how it is.

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,190
Well, it looks good.

22
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,150
Let me just increase these a little bit more.

23
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,720
It's better now.

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,430
After that, I moved the located exactly here in the center.

25
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,840
I opened the layer and parent to the camera layer.

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,660
I hide, the map shames for now.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,750
This layer to.

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,290
I just want to animate this layer.

29
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:18,570
That's when I go into the Libs path and create a keyframe for its size and another one for stroke width.

30
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,140
I press you so I can only see keyframes.

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,520
Hear that the magnifier is at the top.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,030
I increase the size of the stroke.

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,850
My stroke was too.

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,780
Until.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,060
Isolate the keyframes and reverse the.

36
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,330
I go five frames forward and set the first key frames there.

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,820
Again, I go to the second to set the stroke width on zero so it becomes hidden at first and it appears

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,960
after five frames and then its size gets back to the original size.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,530
After I'm done with the locator stroke.

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,660
I go into the locator group.

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:17,020
In a wide eye open path and increase the size, as you can see, because I use merge path and said it's

42
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,970
more than subtract when I increase its size, the locator hides.

43
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,760
I create a keyframe for each size here.

44
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,660
I go to the second to decrease its size.

45
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,730
So like the key frames and reverse.

46
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,450
Its size should be exactly the same as the stroke path.

47
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,120
As you can see, the locator is crooked.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,750
That's because I didn't do parenting at the right time.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,440
I go to the second two and appear map players.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,760
The layer is completely level and that's good.

51
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,560
Here I am pairing the layer.

52
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,000
I go to the last keyframe, which the magnifier comes down, allocates in the right place.

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,010
And here I present it again to the camera layer.

54
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,090
I hide my players for now.

55
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,130
And if you pay attention, you see the locator appears and lens completely straight.

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,050
It's really important that you know, in which frame you should parent the layers to another.

57
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,940
After that, I go to the second two, I open the camera layer.

58
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,610
Open the group lens.

59
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,970
Then I go into transform and create a keyframe for this scale.

60
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,530
Here.

61
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,910
And another one for the handle layers.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,740
Because I don't want to create a keyframe for the scale of every one of them.

63
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,110
Isolate these three layers, and by pressing control G I put them in a group and rename it.

64
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,180
I go into it and create a key frame for this scale of the group.

65
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,500
As you can see, its anchor point is here, but it shouldn't be here.

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,620
So I move it to the center of the shape.

67
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,340
I press you key to see all the keyframes.

68
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,210
I said this scale off the lens up to zero here so it becomes hidden.

69
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,010
For hiding these magnifier handles.

70
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,820
I go into the handle group and set the scale to zero.

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,220
Let's have a look and see how the animation is.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,160
The movements of the wide circle locator doesn't match with the magnifier, so I should match them together.

73
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,350
From here, the size of the locators starts to decrease.

74
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,540
And that's where I should put the beginning keyframe of the magnifier scale here.

75
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,770
See how it is.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,670
I should move the second keyframe forward.

77
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,420
So continuous here.

78
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,370
Let's take a look.

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,460
Well, it's fine.

80
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,300
Now I start to animate the map, isolate the map layers first, control G and make them a group animate

81
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,230
group map.

82
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,920
I go to the transform of the group and create a keyframe for this scale.

83
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,130
And when they locate their places down here.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,660
The scale of the group map should start to increase to.

85
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,240
I said it.

86
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,360
Two zero here.

87
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,650
And see how it is.

88
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,930
I want the map to appear in seven frames.

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,580
After the locater landed on the map and the map appeared.

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,700
I want to create a wave kind of shape like this under the locator.

91
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,520
For this, I open the locator.

92
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,900
Select the contents and create an ellipse beneath the locator.

93
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,970
I hold them control.

94
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,960
And according to the viewing angle of the map, I create the circle.

95
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,550
Isolate the libs, press control g and move it to a.

96
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,020
Name it.

97
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,010
Group Wave.

98
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,740
Put it beneath the locator.

99
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,120
First, I create a key frame for its size and frames forward and decrease it size to zero.

100
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,750
Isolate the keyframes and reverse them from Keyframe assistant.

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,490
So it becomes like this.

102
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,280
I should easy ease the second keyframe.

103
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,730
I increase its initial speed a little bit.

104
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,760
I duplicate this ellipse and add a merge path to this group.

105
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,040
And I want the marriage path filled with this orange.

106
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,420
I get a sample of it.

107
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,140
I set the merge path mode on subtract.

108
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,000
And move the players keyframes forward.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,230
So becomes more like this.

110
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,750
Let's see how it is.

111
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,900
It's fine, but I think it's just a little fast, so decrease it.

112
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,820
If I want the wave animation to repeat and doesn't stop, I should use the loop outside expression for

113
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,180
it.

114
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,340
I paste it for this one to.

115
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,790
It's good for now.

116
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,870
Let's see how the animation is.

117
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,760
So far I could create the main actions of the Morph animation.

118
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,900
And now it's time to add bouncing and anticipation to the animation to have a more dynamic animation.

119
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,720
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
