00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,690
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07,930
In this chapter, I want to talk about morphing or transforming one object into another.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,780
Maybe it's not wrong to say that morphing is one of the advanced topics in motion graphics.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,740
And when you learn these techniques entirely and you can transform any object into another, you can

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,750
see that your works will stand one head and shoulders above the other ones.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,990
As you can see in these examples, if you are professional in this technique, you will no longer have

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,930
any restriction on morphing objects and you can transform anything to everything you want.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:45,460
This not being so simple and at the beginning level, generally the best and most attractive parts of

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,930
promotion graphics are the scenes in which we use the morph technique and objects transform into another

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,500
in it.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,010
If I want to talk about the simplest models, I should point out to these kinds of samples that some

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:07,810
lines get morphed together, but these samples are way more vocational in which the technique of masking

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,600
overlapping frame by frame animation or 3D simulation have been used.

14
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:20,530
The important point in morphing that you should pay attention to is that there is no need that two objects

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,410
get morphed together so reasonable.

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:31,120
It is good enough when a viewer can imagine two objects have been transformed together, which for this

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,890
we use high speed, color, shape changing, bouncing or anything that can cause the destruction the

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,040
audience so they can detect the transforming process.

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,560
So let's go and create a simple morph using shape so that we get to know the basics and roles of morph

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,220
practically all working well.

21
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,580
These are the objects that I want to work on and morph into another.

22
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,790
And the reason that I have selected these three objects for morphing is that their shapes and volume

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,040
are completely different, and it may seem hard to move them together at first.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,650
Look.

25
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,750
That's why I have selected these three shapes.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,330
So after you have done this, you get more familiar with morphing different shapes together so that

27
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,370
in the future when you get serious projects in morphing, you can get through it.

28
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,470
Well, in the end, I want this kind of result.

29
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,410
So let's get to the job.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,770
The first thing I should do is relocate the camera to the center of the scene because I want all of

31
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,530
the moves happening in the center of the scene.

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,200
I hide the other objects for now.

33
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,830
In morphing like animation is better than first you do the main actions like transforming, and then

34
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,330
you get to the details like anticipation, bouncing or shape elements that can make your work look better.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,160
So first I do the main actions and then I try to improve the morph.

36
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,470
I go to the first second because I want to add anticipation to the animation later.

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,050
So I skip the first second for now.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,350
The first thing I want to do is that the camera transforms into the magnifier.

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,260
For this, I locate the magnifier in the center too.

40
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:34,650
I set the opacity to 50 so I can see the blue layer, and I start animating the camera.

41
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:41,840
First, I want the camera to rotate, and its lens gets bigger to the same size as the magnifier.

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,100
And this great layer transforms into the magnifier handle.

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,460
And these two layers appear step by step.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,380
For this, I open the camera rotation and create a keyframe for it.

45
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:02,790
I go ten frames forward and rotate the camera so the angle of the camera can be the same as the magnifier.

46
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,060
I open the camera layer in content.

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,170
I go to the group lens and transform and create a keyframe for its scale.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,310
I go ten frames back and create another keyframe.

49
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,190
I go to the second keyframe and change its size to the size of magnifier lens.

50
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,680
Now I start animating this great layer of camera.

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
I go to the second one.

52
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,500
Isolate the grey layer.

53
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,030
Because I want to animate its path.

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,130
I can read it Busier path.

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,700
I create a keyframe for it in second one.

56
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,280
I got in Frames forward and I did the path.

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,150
So it becomes the same size as the magnifier handle.

58
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,700
I appeared the magnifier layer so that I can know how much I should edit the path.

59
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,080
I get back to the second one.

60
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,470
This camera was clearly should fade when the camera is transforming to the magnifier.

61
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,130
That's why I opened the layer.

62
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,600
And rectangle path.

63
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,040
I create a keyframe for the roundness and another keyframe for its size.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,940
So the layer gets smaller and hides behind the lens.

65
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:50,320
Then frames forward, increase the roundness, so it becomes completely circle and decrease the size

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
to zero.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,850
Then I should animate this layer.

68
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,790
And this one.

69
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,310
I should hide them too.

70
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,010
For this, isolate the layers.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,670
This is the rectangle here and this is the flash layer.

72
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,300
So this anchor point in the center of the scene.

73
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,410
An animate the scale of these two layers.

74
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:31,520
I press U.K. so I can only see the key frames I go to in frames ahead and set the shape scale to zero.

75
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,050
As you can see, shapes are located on the lens.

76
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,790
But it shouldn't be like this.

77
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,690
That's why I put the shapes below the lens group.

78
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,990
It's good.

79
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,520
I should animate the lens shadow and hide it.

80
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,990
Well, as you can see, when the camera retains all of the additional points hide and the camera becomes

81
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,010
the magnifier.

82
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,420
Now I should animate the other layers of magnifier handle.

83
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:27,470
I open the magnified layer and in group handle a copy this and this layer to.

84
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:35,630
I go to the camera layer and I select contents and I press control V so they paste in camera contents.

85
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,740
I move to new shapes above the create shape.

86
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,550
I relocate the shapes to the right places so that eventually I have a shape like a reference.

87
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,980
Let's take a look and see how it is.

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,110
And this frame.

89
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,200
I should create a key frame for these two shapes.

90
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,740
I go back to the second one and put these two layers beneath the lens so it can be seen.

91
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,030
Let's take a look at the animation.

92
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,000
That's good.

93
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,840
I should turn this hand layer to white because the reference magnifier was wide.

94
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,740
So this one should be too.

95
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,080
That's why I go to the second one.

96
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,270
Selling the layer.

97
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,590
I open the fill and create a keyframe for its color.

98
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,810
I go to frames forward and pick white color for the magnifier handle.

99
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,500
So for the camera, morph into the magnifier has been completed.

100
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,560
It's the main action is done.

101
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:14,230
And the next lesson, I want to morph the magnifier into the locator and the map.

102
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,220
Good luck.
