1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,490
The next modifier we will talk about it is repeater.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,970
Open share player in content.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,410
Press add button and from modifiers at repeater to the contents.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,250
As you see, immediately after I add repeater modifier, the shape is repeating and as it name implies,

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:34,060
this modifier is used to repeat your shapes and create several shapes like that up and repeat their

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,020
modifier.

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:41,980
The first option is copies, by which you can control the number of shape copies.

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,550
It is set on three.

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,180
You can set it on any number you want.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,570
The next one is offset.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,820
It's better to explain it later.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,730
The next one is composite by which you can define how they overlap each other.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,320
For example, the first one should be on the second one, the second one, and the third, or vice versa.

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,250
The first one, the second one, and the second one beneath the third one.

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,800
The next one is transform, which is most important parameter in this modifier.

16
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,500
Inside transform.

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,630
First option is anchor point.

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,520
We have nothing to do with.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,600
The second option is positioned that as you see, x position is set at 100, meaning that the distance

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,870
between two copies should be 100 pixels.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,370
As I increase this value, the distance between two copies increases, I set it on 100 again.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,200
You can also apply this change in y axis.

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,730
The next option is scale.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,770
Using this option, you can control the scale of the copies you have just like ramp.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,530
The next option is rotation, which you can use for rotating the copies.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,820
The next options are start and end opacity.

27
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,650
By then, you can control the capacity of the beginning or the end of the copies.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Now we have finished all options.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
Let's talk about offset.

30
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,290
Offset performance is based on the settings you apply to transform.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,310
I have only changed the position X of the transform of the repeater.

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,820
Therefore the copies are ordered in this position.

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,880
If I change offset, let me hold down control to make it slower.

34
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,620
I can move them in the same position X that I have changed.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,070
Now, if I change my position and change upset as well, it will move in this direction.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,540
I changed this to zero, this one as well.

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,420
Now if I change a scale like this.

38
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,570
By changing offsets.

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,350
As they go to the right, the stars get smaller and as they go to the left, they get bigger.

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,870
The same thing applies to the rotation and opacity.

41
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,890
After introducing this modifier.

42
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,620
Briefly, let's go to the examples to see when do we mostly use this modifier?

43
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,980
The first example is creating such a background using repeater modifier.

44
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,420
Or this one.

45
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,250
The first background is this one.

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,700
I open the layer.

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,220
This is a background layer.

48
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,990
The gradient color is here and these two are for creating this hive mode.

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,660
I like these and I will create it again.

50
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,730
I use Polygon Tool holding down shift.

51
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,660
I create the shape.

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,140
Disable its feel.

53
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,410
I said it.

54
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,190
Stroke on 3.5.

55
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,770
Change its color to white.

56
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,980
I move it to the left.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,220
I should stick to the frame.

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,840
Now we should repeat it.

59
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:58,780
So to do this, I select contents and from ADD, I add the repeater and I move it above the background

60
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,550
since I don't want it to affect on the background open repeater, transform and decrease exposition

61
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,190
to place them next to each other.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,610
Then you can increase the number of the copies until they completely fill the scene.

63
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,510
Select shape and repeater press control and g to move them to a group.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,580
Then we add another repeater.

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,810
Move the repeater above background.

66
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,630
I said copies to two.

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,790
And it transformed said exposition to zero and increase the Y position.

68
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Let's zoom in.

69
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,930
It's OC.

70
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,040
Then we move the repeater and this group to a new group.

71
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,200
Then I add another repeater to the shape.

72
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,450
Then we set position X to zero and said Y two.

73
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,450
Let's see, what number should it be set on?

74
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,020
78.

75
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,140
Now you can set the number of the copies.

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,880
It's nine.

77
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,550
You see now we have created this background so easily.

78
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,270
You can easily create this background as well.

79
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,590
Let me delete these.

80
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,480
I select contents.

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,810
I add a shape to the contents.

82
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,480
Then we had to repeat there to the shape player.

83
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,690
I said the copies number to ten.

84
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,870
Decrease its exposition to place them next to each other.

85
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,040
13 is fine.

86
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,480
I set the start capacity on 80 and set end to 15.

87
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,490
Now we have such a shape.

88
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,630
Set the start to 72 seem like fade a bit.

89
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,060
Sixties.

90
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,540
Mother.

91
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,020
Yeah.

92
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,250
Then group these two and add another repeater to the scene.

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,610
Here.

94
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,650
First we said position X.

95
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,490
Set it on 130.

96
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,230
Change it to 132 to be a bit far from each other.

97
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,500
Said copies to ten.

98
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,860
Change, it's offset.

99
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,740
Let me change it to feet to see the top right corner better.

100
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,460
Change it to minus six.

101
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,770
It's better now.

102
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,120
Change their copies to 13.

103
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,270
14.

104
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,340
That's better.

105
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,430
It created this background that much easy.

106
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,650
The next really useful example of repeater modifier is repeating the shapes.

107
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,190
For example, in such for animation, we have a part here.

108
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,170
Here is a file that we go for war.

109
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,590
The.

110
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,470
File is repeated, windows repeated.

111
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,280
Again, the window is repeated again.

112
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,300
The same part.

113
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,140
And so on.

114
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,930
You can create such background using repeater.

115
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,290
Open the background composition.

116
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,480
As you see, we have placed three files here and three windows.

117
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,690
Look here.

118
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,170
If I open the files layer and hide this repeater, you can see that the two other files are removed.

119
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,000
You see, even the single file is created using repeater modifier.

120
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,590
I disable the repeater.

121
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,780
First of all, you had just one dropper which I repeated that using repeater and made four of that and

122
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,740
again using repeater, I repeated the whole file.

123
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,790
I did the same with the windows.

124
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,910
Attention that if I disable the repeater, the rest of the windows will be removed.

125
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,370
As you see, one of the usages of this modifier is the situations that you want to copy the objects

126
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,140
and make a busy background.

127
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,460
The next example is creating such a thing.

128
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,050
Let's create such a shape and animation.

129
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,340
Let this enable title action safe.

130
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
First create a shape from this point.

131
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,480
After that go to contents shape.

132
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,510
We don't need its feel.

133
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,340
Change the stroke line.

134
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,660
Cap to round cap to make its corners round the.

135
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,180
Then open transformed parameter of the shape and create a key frame for its position.

136
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,550
Go ten frames forward.

137
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,360
And move the shape up until here.

138
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,350
I set the stroke to five.

139
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,340
Change this stroke to ten.

140
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,600
It's better now.

141
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,770
Now add a trim path modifier to the shape.

142
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,090
Zoom in a bit.

143
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,750
First of all, nothing of the shape should be visible so set and parameter to zero and create a key

144
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,440
frame.

145
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,090
Go three frames forward.

146
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,610
Now the shape should be set to 100.

147
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,560
Press you to see the keyframes.

148
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:41,730
Easy is the second key frame of the position of the shape to make its final movement a bit smoother.

149
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,010
Then create a key frame for a start parameter.

150
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,740
Set it to 100.

151
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,470
Go five frames backward and set it to zero.

152
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,570
Now the shape starts appearing, and as it goes to the end, it disappears.

153
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,870
Let's have a look.

154
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,240
Now we want to repeat the shape.

155
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,800
Contents.

156
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,770
Add.

157
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,660
Choose Repeater.

158
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,710
Enable title action save.

159
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,930
All three of them move together.

160
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,500
We don't want to repeat this imposition.

161
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,870
We want it happen in rotation.

162
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,040
So the number of the copies to eight and set its exposition to zero.

163
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,060
And set the rotation to 45 degrees to have the copies in equality stances.

164
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,310
Now we have this.

165
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,750
Let me disable title action safe.

166
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,340
In order to make it more interesting, I add another shape.

167
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:25,050
Press control shave to create the shape exactly from center and completely symmetry.

168
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,570
Now we have created the Ellipse.

169
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,450
Move it below the repeater.

170
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,770
Open it.

171
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,080
Remove its field.

172
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,000
Open ellipse path.

173
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,050
Create a keyframes for its size.

174
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,200
Drag it to frame ten.

175
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,250
Go to the first frame and set it to zero.

176
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,590
Now is he eased the second key frame.

177
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,920
Let's have a look.

178
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,890
Up in a stroke and create a keyframe for a stroke with a keyframe in the beginning.

179
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,440
Go to this frame.

180
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,000
Here.

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Set it to 20.

182
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,770
At the end set it to zero.

183
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,310
It should be said, and zero in the beginning as well.

184
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,560
Let's see.

185
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,280
It is very wide.

186
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,320
So set it on 15.

187
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,100
It is the first and last frame and said this one on Otto busier.

188
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,380
It's better now.

189
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,930
Let's limit the work area here.

190
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,490
The circle should be a bit smaller from these lines.

191
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,580
So move the indicator to the middle of the animation.

192
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,960
Double click on the last key frame of the size of the ellipse.

193
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,860
Now decrease its value to make it better.

194
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,590
Let's see how it looks.

195
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,930
These lies appear so fast.

196
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,590
Therefore move the Anki frames here to prevent them from appearing so fast.

197
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,810
Go back a bit.

198
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,370
It's fine.

199
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,150
To make it even better.

200
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,160
I duplicate this ellipse and drag it here and change its color to yellow.

201
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,710
A bit to the right.

202
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,880
Change its capacity to 60.

203
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,440
As you see using repeater.

204
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,130
We have made such a thing and you can create better examples as you like and based on your creativity.
