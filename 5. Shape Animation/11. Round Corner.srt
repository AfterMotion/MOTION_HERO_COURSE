1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,230
The next modifier we will talk about is round corner.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,880
We have a square here and we want to add round corner modifier to it.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,610
Immediately after we add the modifier to this shape, its corners become smoother.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,220
Inside the modifier we have reduced parameter.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,550
By that you can adjust the smoothness of the corners.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,730
You may wonder what's the difference between this modifier and the roundness parameter in the shape

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,360
layer?

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,550
Now.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,110
I will explain it for you.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,080
Let me delete this.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,900
I sell it.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,060
Its roundness to zero.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,850
Sometimes after you create a rectangle, you may want to adjust it manually, so you convert it to busier

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,570
paths.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,150
Then you apply some changes to it like this.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,690
After that, you may need to make the corners smoother.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,160
In this case, you won't have round this parameter in a shape layer.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,920
So you need to use round corner modifier to make the corners of the shape smoother.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,450
Okay.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,880
The first example is a notification.

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,060
Open contents.

22
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,640
This is the rectangle we have created.

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,270
We want to create this notification.

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,390
First.

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,800
Let me let this.

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,540
I click on the contents, I select rounded Rectangle Tool.

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,160
Then I create a rectangle here.

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,900
I move it beneath the shaped layers.

29
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,650
I open a rectangle path and increase its roundness.

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,810
I move it up it to maintain its symmetry.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,280
Now we need to add a triangle here.

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,370
So you have to convert the shape to busier path.

33
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,200
Then using pencil, I create a triangle here.

34
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,010
Now we need to make these corners smoother.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,590
Here we don't have roundness anymore.

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,690
So we select rectangle and add round corner modifier.

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,770
Immediately the corners gets rounded.

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,610
You can also control the roundness of the corners easily.

39
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,060
Now we want this corner to get smoother and we don't want these corners to get rounded.

40
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,080
So alter and left, click on the point to see the handles.

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,180
Hold down alt and make these corners sharp using handles.

42
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,820
Do the same thing for the other points.

43
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,120
Strides in the hand also.

44
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,420
Now only the corners we want will become rounded with round corner.

45
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,870
So when you reveal a point handles round corner won't affect that points and round corner will only

46
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,890
affect the corners that their handles are not revealed.

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,380
Let's go to the next example.

48
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,730
In this example, we want to create such esteem for this shape.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
We have such an animation.

50
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,370
We want to create such a steam using round corner.

51
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,870
So I delight this shape player.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Let me zoom in.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
We create a shape close to this part of the coffee cup?

54
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,150
Exactly.

55
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,420
In the size of the opening door of the coffee cup.

56
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,130
Disable its stroke.

57
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,630
Change its field color to color of the stroke of the coffee cup.

58
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,050
Open rectangle to let this stroke.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,790
Increase its size in y axis.

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
Set it to ten.

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,390
Said this 1 to 30.

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,460
Now duplicate this rectangle.

63
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,840
Open IT settings, move it up a bit and make it tangent of the rectangle.

64
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,470
Decrease its size in x axis.

65
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,900
Then add a repeater modifier.

66
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,510
Set copies to 20 open transform.

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,600
Said position ex of the repeater to zero and increase y position until the shapes become completely

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,280
tangent to each other.

69
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,650
It's fine.

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,470
Increase its scale in X direction.

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,020
Now as it goes up, its scale will increase.

72
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,580
We can edit its crookedness by moving the anchor points.

73
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,840
We add wiggle transfer modifier to the shape and place it below the repeater.

74
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:16,450
Open transform of the wiggle transfer set position X to 15 to change its shape like this.

75
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,510
Now we add merge path modifier.

76
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,610
To let its stroke.

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,230
At path to turn all shapes into a single shape.

78
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:41,060
Finally we add round corner modifier to it to make it seem like a steam or smoke.

79
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,880
Let's see.

80
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,110
Let me swallow the layer to only see the layer.

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,780
It's a bit fast.

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,140
Open wriggle transfer, said Weagle.

83
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,570
Second to 0.5.

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,240
Sometimes this shapes get apart from each other to prevent it.

85
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,460
We should decrease x a bit.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
We set it to ten.

87
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,230
It's better to decrease the size of the second rectangle.

88
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,170
Then open the repeater and decrease the offset of the shape until where the original shape is.

89
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,110
Create a keyframe for its offset.

90
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,780
Then at the second six, move the offset to zero.

91
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,240
Let's see.

92
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,790
It's OC.

93
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,960
Exit the solo mode to see the whole animation.

94
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,420
Exactly in a frame that the door of the cop stands on the cop.

95
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,150
We should set the beginning of the shape layer, move it down a bit.

96
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,770
Exactly beneath the cop.

97
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,780
Now we should mask the shape in order to see the shape in this area and make it hidden here.

98
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,480
So select the layer, select the pen tool.

99
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,050
Now enable the tool creates mask.

100
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,570
Now start creating mask.

101
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,140
Said the father on 50.

102
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,950
Let's see.

103
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,750
Move the shape a beat up.

104
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,780
Now it looks better.

105
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,560
We can set the capacity of the layer on Thursday to look better.

106
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,660
This was another use of round corner modifier.

107
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,290
Good luck.
