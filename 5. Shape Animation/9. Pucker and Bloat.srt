1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,810
The next modifier is poker and bloat.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,540
It is used to make your shape loose and poker.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,860
So I open poker and blow its modifier.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,470
In it.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,420
We have the amounts parameter.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,140
This is below the status and this is poker status.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,650
It just stretches the points inside and outside.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,310
So you can create such a status.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,850
Like flower and such a diamond shape.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,320
By increasing this amount, you can create abstract shape in order to see what happens to different

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,160
shapes using this modifier.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,680
I have created all these shapes.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,720
Let's see what happens if I increase this value here.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,580
The points are stretched inside and here as well.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,080
You see this is rounded rectangle.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,690
The points are stretched inside.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,920
This is a circle and its points are here and stretched inside as well.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,990
The same thing is happened for the polygon and poly star.

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,480
You see now they are stretched inside and now they are stretched outside.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,960
So using this modifier you can create such shapes or you can create abstract shapes.

21
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,830
Now let's go to the example and use this modifier.

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,490
We have a project like this and we want to coin shine.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,670
I play it to see its animation.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,730
We want this part of the coin to shine as it spins in the air.

25
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,210
So zooming.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,380
Exactly.

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,720
At this point, I create a circle.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,220
We don't want it's stroke and let's set its feel and white.

29
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,520
Then at poker and blow it modifier to eight.

30
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,490
I make it solo to just see this layer and proceed the task faster.

31
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,750
Decrease its amount parameter to look like this.

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,030
Set it on -60.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,500
And we want to animate it.

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,730
Open our lips.

35
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,080
Create a keyframe for its size.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,020
And another one for a mountain press.

37
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,970
You go ten frames back and change the circle size to zero.

38
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,670
It comes here, and after ten frames, it turns into zero.

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,610
Easy is the middle keyframe.

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,700
Go to the middle key frame of the size and go five frames back.

41
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:19,000
So the first key frame of the amount here and after ten frames set it to -90 to have such a shape.

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Now let's see.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,470
How does it look?

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,640
Press you key.

45
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,540
Close the beginning and the end of the layer.

46
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,220
After creating that as the coin reaches its climax point.

47
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,350
I mean this point.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,340
Our shape should be placed here.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,610
Duplicate it.

50
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,470
Move it here.

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,570
Duplicate it again.

52
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,850
And place it here.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,230
Let's have a look.

54
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,960
When it is here, the shape should be animated first, then this one.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,670
So I move it here.

56
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,730
And finally, when the reflection of the coin is here.

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,700
The third shape should be placed here.

58
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,640
Okay, let's see the result.

59
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,930
Move this a bit.

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,150
If you want the stars to move with the coin.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,950
You can parent them to the rink back layer.

62
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,320
Which is the Slayer.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,110
At this point.

64
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,420
Parent This one to the layer.

65
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,830
And here, the third layer.

66
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,810
Let's have a look.

67
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,160
The third star should be placed here.

68
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,800
You can create such shining mode using this modifier.

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,740
Let's have a look at the animation.

70
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,230
That's really good.
