1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,210
OC last modifier is zigzag.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,630
As its name implies, it is used to make the shape like zigzag.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:19,500
Well, I have created a line open the layer and from the modifiers list adds the exact modifier.

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,880
Immediately after I added these modifiers.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,200
The exact shape.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,110
All opinions.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,240
The first parameter is size.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,060
You can change the size of the zigzag using this.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,770
The next parameter is used to increase the number of the zigzags.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,210
And the last parameter point is used to make the corners of the zigzag line sharper or softer.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,360
After introducing it.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,120
Let's see its usages in motion graphics.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,920
This is my first example.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,290
As you see, you can create such a waves using zigzag modifier.

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,280
Let's see, how can we create such a wave?

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,040
Open the next composition.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,210
We want to change this line into waves using zigzag modifier.

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,980
First, I enable action safe.

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,600
I just remind the area I want this wave to be on.

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,180
Let me zoom in to be more accurate.

21
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,280
From this point.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,580
Until here.

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,010
Then I add zig zag modifier to this line.

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,360
Go to the base wave layer and add zig zag modifier to it.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Open zig zag modifier increase its size to seven.

26
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,100
Placed a ruler.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,670
Exactly.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,170
On this point of the zigzag.

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,420
Then we should add trim path modifier to the shape as well.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,980
And we should remove this part.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,590
Och, it should be 18.

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,990
Let me solo de la here.

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,260
We go to the beginning of the timeline and create a keyframe for the offset parameter of the shape.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,830
Create a keyframe for his position as well.

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,350
Press you to show the keyframes.

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,770
We go ten frames forward.

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,770
Move upset forward until the shape reaches its end.

38
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,340
Exactly here.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
-65.

40
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,270
After that, we move the shape back using position X parameter.

41
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,120
It's okay.

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,370
Then we should look the position.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,500
We should look to offset parameter as well.

44
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,740
Now you see the shape seems like it's going forward, but it is not like a wave.

45
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,980
So we open, zigzag and set the point to smooth.

46
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,090
Let's see how it is.

47
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,370
That's what I wanted.

48
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:44,930
At.

49
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,490
It seems just like a wave.

50
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,490
On Solo de la.

51
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,180
Och, it's a bit fast.

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,180
Move the keyframes a bit forward.

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,150
The wave is ready.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,820
The next thing we need to do here is when the boat goes inside the water, this part of the wave should

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,750
be opened.

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,990
So I alphington wear this layer to the above layer to open this part as the boat impacts the water.

57
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,590
It's okay.

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,010
There is just something wrong.

59
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,580
That's when the boat goes inside the water.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,680
The bottom part of it that goes into the water shouldn't be seen.

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,540
So we duplicate this layer and move it above the boats layer.

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,740
We set it to no track matter.

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,160
Let me follow the boat and wave.

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,010
Then we delete the train path and edit the shape.

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
I disable the stroke and open shape.

66
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,700
They feel to it and change its color to the background color.

67
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,630
Then alpha convertible layer to the neo layer we've created.

68
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,560
Let's see the animation.

69
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,940
As you see, it's totally fine.

70
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,020
As the ball impacts the water, the part behind the water won't be shown anymore.

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,260
Well, one of the good usages of this modifier is such a way that you can easily create with the help

72
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,580
of this modifier.

73
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,870
Good luck.
