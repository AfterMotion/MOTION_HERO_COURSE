1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,430
In this session.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,700
We want to talk about taper and wave options.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,730
These are updated options for a stroke.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,150
In this session, we'll explain how to use these options and their applications in projects.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,270
I have created a stroke here since taper and valve options are used for strokes.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,180
I open its contents in a stroke parameter under dash parameter.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,110
You can see taper and wave parameters.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,190
Taper is used to make the start and end of a stroke thinner.

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,990
Open taper.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,110
The first parameter is the length units.

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,720
Using this parameter, you can set your taper based on Pearson's or pixels.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,430
I set it on.

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:59,230
Pearson's start length is used to make the starting point of this stroke narrower as I increase this

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,960
value.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,670
It becomes narrower from the start point when it is 100.

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,180
Start taper continues to the end.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,490
And if you change it to pixel, its highest value is 600 pixels.

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,520
If you decrease it, it will become thicker.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,770
It applies taper from the starting point based on pixel.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,780
I changed it to percent and set this to 100.

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,990
So start length is for starting point and end.

22
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,140
Length is for end point.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,050
I said both of them to 50.

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,590
Using a start with you can change the width of strokes starting points.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,500
And with is for its end with as well.

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,440
Start ease softens the starting point.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And and ease softens the end point.

28
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,360
These were parameters for taper option.

29
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,640
Let's go to wave.

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,530
Wave, as its name implies, makes the stroke wavy.

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,470
Open wave.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,410
The first parameter is a mount.

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,960
It makes these waves.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,930
You can set the amount of the waves.

35
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,840
The next parameter is units.

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,940
Unit creates waves based on pixel.

37
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,460
It makes one wave every 100 pixels.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,770
As you increase this number, your waves will decrease.

39
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,000
The next parameter is cycle.

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,570
You can set how many waves should a path have?

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,120
For example, I set it to three.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,410
You see?

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,090
One, two, three.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,190
The last parameter is phase.

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,670
It can animate your way of using this parameter.

46
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,960
Now that you're introduced to wave and taper.

47
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,840
Let's go to the examples.

48
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,710
The first example is making such trays for the ship.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,610
And also make these clouds.

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,250
So we want to create this case.

51
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,260
To create this idea, let the shape trace and create them again to completely understand how to use

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,490
these options.

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,090
I create a stroke here?

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
After creating this stroke increase its width.

55
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,140
I move it beneath the shape layer and move it down.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,350
Now change its color to pink.

57
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,690
Up in content shape.

58
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,770
Open a stroke and then set the start length to 100%.

59
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:18,380
Increase its start with increased the stroke size a bit more.

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,680
Now open wave and increase its amount.

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,700
Change it to cycle and set it to three.

62
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,920
Now to have a continuous animation, I'll click on a stopwatch of the phase.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,420
Type.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,580
Time expression for its phase.

65
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,930
You see, the animation of the ship Trace is created so easily.

66
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,310
Let me increase it.

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,350
Start with a bit more.

68
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,970
That's better now.

69
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,220
Now duplicate this shape.

70
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,620
Up in a stroke.

71
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,190
Change its color to allow their color.

72
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,410
Move it beneath the first shape and increase its width.

73
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,550
It will be better if it's a bit lighter.

74
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,360
Now duplicate this shape again, move it above the first shape and decrease its width.

75
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,640
Then open wave.

76
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,200
Change cycle to five.

77
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,500
Increase its way to create such line in the middle.

78
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,390
Increase its amount a bit more.

79
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,280
Change it to 100.

80
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,710
To create two other lines here.

81
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,100
Let me change its name to wave, to replicate this layer.

82
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,390
Open it.

83
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,840
The lead shape three and shape one and only keep shape to open a stroke.

84
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,210
Increase its width.

85
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,310
Open Taper.

86
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,900
Change it.

87
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,830
Start.

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,290
Let's have a look.

89
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,510
Now rename layer two wave line.

90
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,060
Duplicate this layer change wave lines is true color to white.

91
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,350
Apply Alpha inverted Matt to it.

92
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,570
You see, this is created.

93
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,160
Up and contents of the wave line to.

94
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,820
And decrease the stroke with a bit.

95
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,390
So easily.

96
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,700
We created this wave line as well.

97
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,540
Now we want to create such clouds.

98
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,180
Let me hide these.

99
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,170
To create these clouds.

100
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,820
I create a stroke.

101
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,270
It creates its width.

102
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,180
Renamed a layer to cloud.

103
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,930
Opening stroke.

104
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,110
Set the start length to 40.

105
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,580
Set and length to 60.

106
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,000
Now open wave and increase its amount.

107
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,650
And make it start a bit softer.

108
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,890
And it's and is OC.

109
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,420
I'll click on stopwatch of the phase and type time expression for its phase.

110
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,570
It is a bit fast.

111
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,670
Said it to -50.

112
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,080
Now we should create a layer for the matter of the cloud.

113
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,970
Disable its stroke and enable it to feel.

114
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,130
Renamed the layer to match Layer.

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,760
Now I apply alpha inverter to the cloud to only see the part which is out of the shape.

116
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,960
Let's have a look.

117
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,000
So we can do such a things with the clouds using taper and wafer.

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,830
Then move it to the camp and do the same thing that we've done with these layers.

119
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,470
And create a drop shadow for it.

120
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,010
So we can use taper and wave for these kinds of things.

121
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,460
Let's go to the next example.

122
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,020
The coffee cup example.

123
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,800
You can create such a stream for the coffee.

124
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,430
Let's create it.

125
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,920
It's really easy.

126
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,900
I will show you now.

127
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,180
Click here.

128
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,860
Holding down shift, click again here out of the scene.

129
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,970
Then disable, feel and enable the stroke.

130
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,800
Change their stroke with as you wish its end to be.

131
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,040
It's good to be this much.

132
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,250
Then open its contents.

133
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,960
The latch is filled up and Taper said its start length to 100%.

134
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,170
Increase it.

135
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,340
Start with.

136
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,700
Now open a mount and set it to 50.

137
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,750
I think it's better to be on 35 type time expression for its phase.

138
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,310
Then we want to steam fades as it goes up.

139
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,850
So select the layer upon the stroke and select linear gradient.

140
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,370
Here you can select the color you want, like red.

141
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,010
You see, we don't have any red color here.

142
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,430
Because we should set up these handles to see the handles.

143
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,300
Select gradient stroke and click on Pan behind Tool.

144
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,530
Then move there.

145
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,880
Start here at the end button of the stroke and move the end up.

146
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,670
Now as you see Star, these one and end is red.

147
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,100
We don't want the red color.

148
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,050
We want white here.

149
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,640
It's color can be selected.

150
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,700
And from this part you can change its capacity.

151
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,900
I want to set its end opacity to zero.

152
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,640
It can set your opacity gradient using this handle.

153
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
I move it a bit down.

154
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,320
Okay, let's see.

155
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,890
Yes, it's okay.

156
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,490
I should move this layer below the coffee cup layer.

157
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,260
Then when the coffee cup is stops should start coming out of this hole.

158
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,920
To do this move, the starting point of the layer here that it's store is fixed and the coffee cup open

159
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,300
gradient stroke.

160
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,680
We should animate and point in y axis.

161
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,350
As I move it down, it fades.

162
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
Create a key frame for it.

163
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,310
Go 20 frames forward.

164
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,830
Then move it up again.

165
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,850
Let's see.

166
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,730
It's a bit fast.

167
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,000
We want to decrease its opacity in the beginning so open gradients and set the beginning opacity to

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,660
50.

169
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,090
It's fine.

170
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,260
Good luck.
