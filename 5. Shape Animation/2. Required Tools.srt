00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,700
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,030
And before starting the training course, let me briefly explain about the tools I need in the process

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,940
of creating the motion graphics in this course.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,320
The tool I used in this tutorial to change the graph of keyframes and create spring animations is the

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,710
motion to script, which of course it's not free.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:30,780
So those who have this script and don't know how to work with it can easily watch the working with the

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,940
motion to a script course and get acquainted with all the tools available here and those who doesn't

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,450
have this script or cannot afford it should not worry, because we can also do manually the things we

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,000
did with this script in this course.

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,080
For example, I make an animation for this square.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,880
And in order to easy ease the keyframes, it just need to go to the Keyframe assistant and select the

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,930
easy ease.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,210
As you see when I go to the speed graph in graph ed.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,920
A graph like this will be shown.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,060
And when the shape gets the frame, nine and ten has its highest speed.

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,430
At first the speed is low.

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,540
Then it increases and finally it decreases again.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,160
Well, this is the easy ease mood in which in the beginning and at the end of the movement, the animation

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,490
speed reduces.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,710
If I want to use the motion to escape, I will use this option.

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,790
For example, I set it to 70%.

22
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,310
The speed will decrease in the beginning and the end of the animation look.

23
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:02,990
And here this points indicate the frames and the speed is slower at first because more frames are shown

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,600
here in the middle.

25
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,230
The speed is higher because less frames are shown here.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,080
And at the end the animation speed reduces.

27
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,490
You can make changes to your graph using this slider in full control.

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:27,170
As you see both the graph and the spots that exist in the animating path will change.

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,130
The more I increase it, the more the speed of the beginning and ending of the animation decreases and

30
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,680
in the middle of the speed increases.

31
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,410
So this option is for easy ease the keyframe.

32
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,580
When this option is at the left, it makes the keyframes linear and the animate will be completely linear.

33
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,770
And in no part of it does this speed increase or decrease.

34
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,980
And when it is at 100, as you see, the animation would be easy out at the beginning.

35
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,910
The speed is low and it increases in the end.

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,840
This last option when I set it to zero.

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,870
As you see here, the key frame will be toggle hold and the animation is done in a frame as a jump.

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,310
And then I set it to 100.

39
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,830
The animation will be easy and it means that the speed is high at the beginning and lowers at the end.

40
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,100
As you see, I can do all of that here using this handles as well.

41
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,400
I see.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,520
I can easily do the same using these handles and I don't need to use these options.

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,870
But the only difference is that a reward gets faster.

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,370
The next tip I'm going to give you is the excite option.

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:58,450
Let me set the animation an easy out mode so that the speed is low at the beginning and it increases

46
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,230
at the end.

47
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,260
And I want to create a spring animation for it.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,010
I select the keyframes and apply the side option to it.

49
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,180
Now, if you take a look, you'll see that the spring animation is created for the shape.

50
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,820
I go to the effect controls.

51
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,810
And here the first option overshoot, which is the same as amplitude, and shows the distance that the

52
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,900
shape takes from its original position.

53
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,530
If I set this to ten, the shape distance from the last key frame position will reduce.

54
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,970
The next option is bounce, which is the same as frequency and shows the reciprocity of this layer.

55
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,680
For example, when it's on 40, it goes this much when it's on to any.

56
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,210
It will go almost half of this.

57
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,230
And the last option is frixion, which is the same as decay.

58
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,370
That the more I increase it, the spring animation is stopped sooner and the more I decrease it, it

59
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,670
will stop later.

60
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,370
For example, I want to increase it and set it to 80.

61
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,200
Look what happens.

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,730
It is stopped soon.

63
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,070
But if I set it to 20.

64
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,390
As you see, it took longer to stop.

65
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,540
Everything I just did depends on whether I have the motion to script.

66
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,480
But what should I do if I don't have this script?

67
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,310
In order for those who doesn't have this script to be able to go along with us through creating the

68
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,200
animation during the course.

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,490
First, I delete these expressions and effects created by the motion to a script and paste expression

70
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,240
related to creating this spring animation here.

71
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,550
Now, if I play, you'll see that I was able to create the same animation I made using the motion to

72
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,150
script.

73
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,300
Using this expression too.

74
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,590
As you see, its amplitude is high, so I'll set these to 0.5.

75
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,180
It is still can be less than this.

76
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,900
And exactly the same values I had there.

77
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,040
I have here.

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,700
This is the amplitude, which is actually the overshoot.

79
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,510
Frequency is actually the bouncing and DK is actually the friction in motion to escape.

80
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,810
Only their names have changed.

81
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:45,560
I will put this expression in the course resources folder so that you can use it to create your own

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,840
spring and bouncing animations.

83
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,960
That's it for now.

84
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,220
I did not make much use of the other options available in motion to a script.

85
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,920
If you want to get acquainted with all the options of this script, which can help you a lot in creating

86
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,170
beautiful motion graphics, you can get and watch the motion to a script training course.

87
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,220
Good luck.
