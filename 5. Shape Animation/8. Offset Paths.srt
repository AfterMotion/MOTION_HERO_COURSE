1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,610
The next modifier is offset path.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:11,080
As I told before, in order to add a modifier to the scene, we should add a shape open shape layer

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,550
in contents parameter of this layer.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,390
There is an ad and by clicking on this button you can add any modifier you want.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,470
I add offset pass modifier to the shape.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,410
Up an offset path modifier of an offset path modifier.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,350
The first parameter is a mount with which you can expand or abbreviate the shape.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,130
It somehow like scale or size.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,550
But there are some difference that I will explain you.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,560
The first difference is that in order to scale down or scale up the star, you should go to Poly star

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,230
and poly star path.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,280
You want see such parameter for size and you can just do that in transform parameter, which has some

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,690
problems that the size of this stroke will increase simultaneously, which is not interesting at all.

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,050
Go back to offset path modifier.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840
You can easily do this with amount.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,660
You can scale up or down your star, although your stroke size won't change.

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,490
The next parameter is line.

18
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,510
Join that.

19
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,800
As it name implies, it changes the corners of the shape.

20
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,000
Now they set on miter join, which makes the corners sharp.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,880
If you change it to round corners will change into round and bevel, adds Bevel to the corners.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,370
I said it on miter join again.

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,310
The next parameter is miter limits.

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,310
It is used to define the sharp area of the corners.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,520
For example, here, the angle of this part of this star is this.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,690
But if we open Polar Star and increase the angle of these corners in inner radius, you see the shape

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,310
is now like bevel.

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,340
Let me increase my term limits.

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,960
You see, I increased the sharp area of the corners because I want its corners to be sharp in larger

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
radius.

31
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,240
I reset it.

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,390
The next parameter is copy.

33
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,530
Using this parameter, you can have several copy of your shape.

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,420
I set it on five.

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,710
As you see, five copies are out of the main shape.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:51,610
But if you want to create the copies inside the main shape, you should change the amount to a minus

37
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,220
value.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,260
Five copies are too much.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
I set it on three.

40
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,790
I set it on to.

41
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:06,890
When a mount is set on a minus value, the copies will be created inside the main shape and if the amount

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,520
is positive, copies will be created outside it.

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,170
Copy offset is also used to offsetting the copies like this.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,140
Now we have introduced a set path modifier briefly.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Let's go to our example.

46
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:32,530
One of the perfect usages of this modifier is for these kinds of things that you can have such a stroke

47
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,820
around the shape.

48
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,990
We want to create such a stroke for this notification.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,410
So I OpenShift layer contents.

50
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,750
I delete a group of these stroke since I want to create it again.

51
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,580
To do this.

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,690
I use this rectangle.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,180
Let me disable this to understand better.

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,930
I use this shape to create the stroke I mentioned.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,560
So I duplicate this layer and move it down.

56
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,600
You might think that you can do this by just scaling, but that is not true.

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,800
I hide this layer, I select this shape, I reveal this layer.

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,640
I press control DT.

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,440
I want to scale it.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,310
As you see when I scale it, that is not interesting enough.

61
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,210
By moving it, we can't create it easily as well.

62
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,310
We should try a lot to make the space between the shape and a stroke.

63
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,960
The same everywhere.

64
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,980
It's so hard and it's better for you to use a set path modifier.

65
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,390
So I press control Z.

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,730
I return to the first mode.

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,860
I reveal these ones.

68
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,840
This is the main shape and this one is the shape that we want to create a stroke from.

69
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,400
I press control g to move it to a group.

70
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,020
I open the group.

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,150
Add offset path modifier to eight.

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,170
Increase the amount.

73
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,550
You have some space.

74
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,960
As you see the space all around, the shape is the same.

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,000
And we have done that with and we have done that without any problems.

76
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,600
Here, you can decide whether to be sharp set and miter or you want it to be smooth.

77
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,660
So set it on round.

78
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,940
I want it to be sharp.

79
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,530
Then open rectangle.

80
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,270
I don't want the feel of the second stroke, so I delete it.

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,690
Open a stroke eye.

82
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,730
Click on Dash to turn the stroke into dashes.

83
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,050
I click again and change its settings.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,590
I press it again to make it a regular.

85
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,090
Then in line cap parameter select round cap to have rounded stroke corners.

86
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,560
To rotate this troll continuously alt and left click on a stopwatch of the offset parameter.

87
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,270
Here.

88
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,780
Time.

89
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,520
Time 100.

90
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,380
I think the diameter of this stroke is a bit much.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,450
So go to stroke width and set it to eight.

92
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,380
I want to reverse its rotation.

93
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,890
I change 100 to -100.

94
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,840
So here is the animation of this stroke.

95
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,140
The next example is creating such thing.

96
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,380
So open shape content.

97
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,580
Andela, this wave, since we want to remake it.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,970
Also the litter offset path, so the shape is inside the group.

99
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,920
Duplicate this group.

100
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,660
Remove the animation created for this scale.

101
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,860
After removing its animation, click on Contents and add offset path modifiers to it.

102
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,290
Move with benefit group to.

103
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,220
I had this layer to better know what is going on.

104
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,060
By increasing the amount of the offset path.

105
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,450
All shapes that are inside the group will be offset separately.

106
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,080
We don't want this.

107
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,070
We want all of them to be recognized as a single shape.

108
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:48,550
So open group and add merge path modifiers to it immediately after adding it of said parser recognized

109
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,220
all of that as a single shape and the sets all shapes as one shape.

110
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,370
Now, inside the group layer we don't need fill anymore, so I disable it.

111
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,010
Then I enable group one.

112
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,090
From this point, that offset path has covered around the shape.

113
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,890
I start animating it.

114
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,750
Create a key frame for it.

115
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,580
Go to second one.

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,690
Increase its amount.

117
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
This march.

118
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,860
Then create a key frame for a stroke with.

119
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,250
Finally set it on zero.

120
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,150
Press you to see the keyframes.

121
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,570
Then the sun comes here and from here on it gets larger.

122
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,780
In order to coordinate the animation of the wave with the sun and make it loop and continuous.

123
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,620
Drag these two key frames for words to have the same duration for the animation of the wave and so on.

124
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,640
And create loop hound expression for these two as well.

125
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,600
Press control C and paste it here.

126
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,240
Let's have a look.

127
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,390
It's fine.
