00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,380
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,090
As you know, this course topic is about the shape tool in motion graphics.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,390
You may be wondering why shape when we can do all the designs in Illustrator or Photoshop.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,510
Why do it in after effect using the shape tool?

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,800
You should know that after effects shape tool in addition to the capabilities and features that the

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,150
Shape tool has in Illustrator and Photoshop has many other features that you can only find in after

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,230
Effects, which can help you in both designing and creating beautiful animations and motion graphics.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,740
Let's see some examples of the power of this tool in After Effects to fully understand why we need to

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,710
do the motion graphic designs in after Effects.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,430
Suppose we want to make such a shape.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,620
If we make it manually after the shape is made to be able to sharpen these rounded corners, we must

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,990
fix all of them one by one.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:09,690
But when we use the round corner modifier to round this corners, we just need to go to the shape and

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,850
set the round corner to zero.

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,900
You can see how easily we were able to sharpen the corners of the gear.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,790
Or for example, we don't want such a state.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,920
We want the gear to change to this state.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,560
See, as soon as I change it, the shape automatically changes completely.

19
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:38,470
Or, for example, if you want to increase or decrease in number of these gear teeth, you'll just need

20
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,990
to use the repeater modifier.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,010
You can see how easily we are able to increase or decrease number of the gear, teeth or do anything

22
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,060
else we want.

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,670
And we won't need to make changes to each one of these gear teeth separately.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,770
Another feature the shape provides us is that we can create such strokes around the shapes in perfectly

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,920
symmetrical shapes such as circles or squares.

26
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,920
It won't be that difficult.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,420
We can also create it manually, but in such shapes which are not fully symmetrical, you can hardly

28
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,050
do it.

29
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,400
I'll show you.

30
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,890
Let me disable this truck.

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,910
First, we need to make a duplicate of this truck, selects its path, and then resize it.

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,260
When I changed the scale.

33
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,160
Even though these parts are correct, this part are not very accurate, and you must spend hours to

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,460
be able to manually create this trick I showed you.

35
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,750
Therefore, we can easily use the offset path modifier and create such a stroke very simply.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,770
You can also adjust the distance between this truck and your shape.

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,410
Another good feature and ability of the shape tool is that you can easily create such backgrounds very

38
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,880
simply and easily.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,260
I'll show you.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,470
As you see, this is the background I have created.

41
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,190
For example, this is the monitor layer, which I have repeated it using the repeater and as well as

42
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,550
the flower pots and the drovers layer.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,230
As you can see, I have created three brewers using the repeater.

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,990
And as for this Drew, where itself, I had only created the upper part of it.

45
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,600
I created such a rumor and then repeated it.

46
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,900
Now, if you want to make changes to these files, you just need to go to this shape that you primarily

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,880
made and easily change.

48
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,590
The color and the color of all the other parts will change.

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,080
So you won't need to select these drawers one by one and change their color.

50
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,220
You can also change the form of your shape and apply it completely onto other drivers as well.

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,930
And finally creates such a scene.

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,310
Another good feature is that we can combine several modifiers and create such beautiful shapes.

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,740
For example, to create this shape.

54
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,840
I have used the repeater modifier, wiggle, transform, merge path and round corner, which by disabling

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:52,040
them you can see what effect did each one of these modifiers have on this shapes and you will learn

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,940
in detail how to create them during the course.

57
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,260
Another ability is to create such animations.

58
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,860
As you can see, I have animated the lines using the Treme path modifier.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,580
You can do such a thing only by the Treme path modifier and after effects.

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,420
Or for example, you can create such a mood for grouping plans using this modifier in your work.

61
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,960
In this example.

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,740
As you can see, we have created two lollipops.

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,800
I have made this a spiral shape inside the lollipops using the twist modifier.

64
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,060
It was just a straight line and I did the work using the twist.

65
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,340
If you want to do such a thing manually, it takes a long time to create such a shape with the pen tool,

66
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,840
which in the end it may not be as accurate and beautiful.

67
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,460
As well as this lollipops, which has been created by twist and repeater.

68
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,940
First I created this piece and then repeated it using the repeater and twisted it using the twist.

69
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,020
The next feature that ships gives us is that you can create visual animation for all the elements inside

70
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,250
your shape layer.

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,840
While, if you want to create such animation manually, you must write the visual expression for each

72
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,250
one of these shapes separately and set each one of them separately.

73
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:43,050
But through the wiggle transferring modifier and using a controller, you can easily control the wiggle

74
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,200
of these elements and you won't need to create the wiggle animation for each of the elements.

75
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:58,980
As you see, the wiggle transfer modifier has greatly simplified the work in this plan and has saved

76
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,300
a lot of the time.

77
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,520
The next feature.

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,750
The shapes in after effects give us is to be able to create such a vibrational state for the shapes.

79
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:18,100
As you see, we have made such animations using the visual path without needing to create these vibrational

80
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,600
shapes one by one.

81
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,900
In this example, we have created such a repo using the zig zag modifier that making it manually not

82
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,300
only takes a long time, but also takes a lot of energy from us.

83
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,500
I think so far it is quite clear to you why we have to use the shape tool in After Effects to design

84
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,820
the motion graphics.

85
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:53,160
It is true that Illustrator and Photoshop are for design and are great for single frame design, but

86
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,120
you should know that After Effects is also for designing motion graphics and it has its own tools for

87
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,000
designing and creating motion graphics clips.

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,550
As we saw after effects shape too.

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Apart from being a very powerful tool, it has many capabilities and features that cannot find in other

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,410
software.

91
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,430
Specifically, when you want to produce motion graphics that can simple your job a lot and take away

92
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,810
less time from you.

93
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:31,610
Another thing I have to say is that this course is suitable for people who have a brief acquaintance

94
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:39,110
with after effects to better be able to follow the course exercises and create motion graphic scenes.

95
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,530
Also, in order not to face any problems in creating keyframes and animations, I suggest you to watch

96
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,510
the course of creating animations and working with keyframes in after effects.
