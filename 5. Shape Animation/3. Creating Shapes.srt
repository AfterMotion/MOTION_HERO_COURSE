1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,060
In this session, we're going to talk about shapes.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,360
There are two ways for creating a shape.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,620
The first one is manually in which you use pen tool and create the shape.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,350
I select pen tool.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,940
I click once.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,290
After the first click, the first point will be created and one shape layer will create in timeline.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,790
Hold down shift, click one more time and create a straight line.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,140
I click again and create a square.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,800
There are some other tools in this menu, for example, at Vertex Tool.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
It allows us to create a vertex in any point that we want.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,170
The next tool is delete vertex.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,060
Like its name by this tool you can delete Vertex.

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,140
The next one is converse Vertex tools.

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,530
Using this tool, you can edit vertex.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,030
If I click on a point using this tool point handles of the shape will appear.

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,500
Thus you can edit them.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,670
As you see, normally when you start editing, you can edit just one handle.

18
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:31,130
But if you want to move both handles together, you should hold alt and click on the points and drag

19
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,240
it.

20
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,860
How can we open a shape after closing it?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,110
For example, if you want to open your shape from this side.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,720
You should select two points of the side.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,270
You want to open the shape from right click and from Mask and Shape Path.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,500
Uncheck the closed option.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,130
You see the shape open from the side that you choose.

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,280
Press control there to undo it.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,780
This was the manual way.

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,360
There is another way that you can use this parametric shapes to create your shape.

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,520
Be careful that none of the layers must be selected in timeline.

30
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,050
Since if, for example, this shape layer was selected and you create a rectangle.

31
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:32,230
As you see, this rectangle won't be placed in a separate shape layer and it will be created in a layer

32
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,730
of the previous one.

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,040
And we don't want this.

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,440
We want to place the rectangle in a new shape layer.

35
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,230
So we unselect all layers and start drawing.

36
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,600
As you see, when I drag, the shape is created from its corner and I can define its length and width.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,090
But if I hold shift, all sides will be symmetric.

38
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,900
So this was the second method.

39
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:12,400
The difference between these two methods is that in first method, by using convert vertex tool, you

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,900
could edit your points.

41
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,580
But in the second one, if you select the tool, you can't do that.

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,160
But never mind using convert to base your path tool.

43
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,330
You can edit rectangle paths.

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,170
To do this.

45
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,430
Open Shape Layer.

46
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,320
Contents.

47
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,830
Rectangle Rock.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,330
Click on Rectangle Path and select Convert to busier path.

49
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,010
Now you can edit the shape using convert vertex tool.

50
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,160
Price controls are there to undo it.

51
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,940
Okay, let's go to the next parameter shape rounded rectangle.

52
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,210
This is a rectangle that has rounded corners.

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,150
Hold shape to have symmetrical sides.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,690
While dragging.

55
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,460
You can increase or decrease the roundness of the corners by scrolling.

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,520
Now am decreasing.

57
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,180
Let me make it bigger.

58
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,700
Now I'm craving the roundness.

59
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,850
The next one is Ellipse tool, with which you can create circles.

60
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:27,270
You can hold down control in order to create the circle from the center and from the point that you

61
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,960
click on.

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,920
And also by holding shift and control, you can create an accurate round circle and it won't turn into

63
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,430
Ellipse.

64
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,540
The next one is Polygon Tool.

65
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,010
Let me create one.

66
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,440
I hold down control to be created from the center.

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,460
I also hold down shift to have equal sides by scrolling.

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
You can decrease or increase the shape sides.

69
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,550
As you see, when I created this shape, I forgot to deselect the previous shape layer.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,380
Therefore, the shape is placed inside the previous shape layer.

71
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,010
I don't want this, so I like this shape and select the circle.

72
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,730
Now I start making the new shape layer.

73
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,100
Well, the next one is a star tool and you can create a stars using it.

74
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,360
By scrolling.

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,940
You can increase or decrease its wings.

76
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,480
By holding control, you can adjust the wings length.

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,040
You see, I'm holding down control and I can adjust the wings length.

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,190
You can do all these things only if you hold down left click of your mouse.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,120
Otherwise, if you release it, it won't be possible anymore.
