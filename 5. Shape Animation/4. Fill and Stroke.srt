1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,170
In this session, we're going to talk about filling a stroke of the shapes.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,090
I create a rounded rectangle in the center of the scene.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,110
I increase its roundness by scrolling.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,970
OC It's good.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:23,440
As you see, when we select a shape at the top, three options appear fill, stroke and width, which

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,180
is the width of the stroke.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,570
Here we can select the field color of the shape.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,240
I click on it and change its color.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,010
If you click on field text, a window will appear that has a couple of options in it.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,170
The first one is none with which the field will be removed from the shape.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,510
The second option is solid color.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,870
It fills our shape with one single color.

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,580
The next one linear gradient.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,950
It makes us a gradient.

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,260
And with the help of these handles, you can adjust the combination amount of the colors.

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,240
And the last option is radial gradient, which makes you a radial gradient here, the capacity and you

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,450
can adjust its transparency by this option.

18
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,730
You see, I can adjust the combination amount of this gradients by using this handle.

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,230
Also, I can come here and by clicking on this button, change its color.

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,200
And also this one.

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,270
So we can change the color of the gradient.

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,490
Stroke is the same as feel.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,890
It has non cells, color, linear gradients and radial gradients.

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,510
And here is the opacity.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,960
By clicking here, you can change the colors as well.

26
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,840
And here is its width and you can change its thickness.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,820
You have these options in timeline on the rectangle path.

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,750
Set this on solid color.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,970
It will feel.

30
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,570
And if it was gradient, this would be gradient too.

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,890
Here you can disable or enable the stroke here.

32
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,250
Or enable or disable feel I open a stroke.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,340
The first option is composite, and you can choose the stroke to be below the other objects or above

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,880
them.

35
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,930
Since now the stroke is above the field.

36
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,610
It is not recognizable.

37
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,620
I will move it below the field.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,370
Now this stroke is below other objects.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:55,020
If I select above, the stroke will be placed above the other objects, although its below fail.

40
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,860
Let me change it to default and move it above the field.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,620
The next option is color.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,900
You could change it from here as well, and you can change your opacity from this part as well.

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,130
Stroke width is the thickness of it.

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,740
Here is line chap.

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,040
Let me create a line here to explain.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,150
Line cap better disable title action save.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,080
Upon the stroke of this shape to explain line cap.

48
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,820
This option makes the end of your lines, Cap.

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,360
Or round.

50
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,180
Or projection that includes the whole path in it.

51
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,180
If it is set to bad cap, it will be placed at the end of path.

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,480
So long cap is for the end of lines and line join is for the corners.

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:07,060
For example I changed line join to round you see the corner will change into round either makes it sharp

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,490
round makes it round and bevel makes the corner like bevel.

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,980
The next option, which is important is Dash.

56
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,580
You can change the stroke into dashes by clicking on this plus icon.

57
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,150
By dash property, you can increase the length of dashes.

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,650
I press.

59
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,080
Plus, once more, your property increases the space between these dashes.

60
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,490
So gap increases, the space between dashes and dash increases the length of dashes.

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,190
And I've said we'll move these dashes.

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,680
Now open field property.

63
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,170
Here we have composite, which is the same as a stroke.

64
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,380
This places the field under other layers.

65
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,780
And above previous in same group places the layer above the others.

66
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,920
By choosing this, although feel is below this stroke, this option places feel above the others.

67
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,890
I said this to its default setting.

68
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,320
The next option is field rule, which is used when your shape is too complicated.

69
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,720
Let me explain it briefly.

70
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,680
For this kind.

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,120
Things we often feel when it is said a non zero widening the field contains the whole shape and its

72
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,550
visible are over the shape, but in even odd mode, close areas of the shape won't contain the feel.

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's go back to our example.

74
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,970
I explained field rule.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,150
Color is obvious and we already know opacity.

76
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,060
So these were fuel parameters.

77
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,570
But here if we set feel on linear.

78
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,100
They feel will change into gradient feel and we will have more options as well.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,820
You cancer type two radial or linear?

80
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:23,340
In order to make the handles of the gradient visible select gradient feel and then select pen behind

81
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,970
tool.

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,250
As you see, the handles appear.

83
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,520
Star point is this one which shows the area of the first color and end point is the second one, which

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,800
shows the area of the second color.

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,020
And here we have a combination of two colors in color property.

86
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,580
It can choose colors.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,580
And here you can set its opacity.

88
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,790
For example, you can set it to zero.

89
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,740
You see here it disappears.

90
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,460
And this is the capacity of the whole gradient.

91
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,250
And the next part we will discuss about the rest of the shape parameters.
