1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,200
In this session, we will talk about shape modifiers.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,260
By shape modifiers, we can make changes to the shapes and passes.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,480
To create modifiers, you should create a shape.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,800
Here I have created a square and circle in content parameter.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,020
If you click on this icon next to add bottom, you can see modifiers in a bottom of this menu.

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,430
The first one is mash paths and the last one is zigzag.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,950
In this session I will talk about marriage path, so I click on marriage path and add it to the content.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,710
Now match path is is added to the content and shape colors changed since merge path adds a separate

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,810
field and a stroke to the shape.

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,440
We don't need its fill so I disable it for now and we will just keep this stroke open.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,370
Merge path.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,160
Merge path like its name is used for merging and combining the shapes.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,300
In match path.

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,310
We have mode by this option.

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,340
You can combine your shape in different ways.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,670
Marriage is the first option.

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,850
It helps you combine both shapes together in a way that none of them overlays the other.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,520
For example, I enable feel here.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,930
I disable the mesh path.

20
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,060
I place the square here.

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,660
You see, since I moved this square here, the circle is overlaying this square.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,310
But when you enable a path, fill and a stroke of both shapes will be visible.

23
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,630
This is useful when you don't want any of your shapes to be placed on another, and you want them both

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,160
to have filling stroke.

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,580
I disabled feel.

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,140
I move it back.

27
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,830
You can add another shape to the existing one using this option.

28
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,150
As you see, if I move this square closer to the circle, they will match with each other.

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,510
I drag it forward.

30
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,450
You see, they are merged.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,200
If I enable Phil Now, it seems like they are a single shape.

32
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,180
I changed the field color.

33
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,640
The next one is subtract.

34
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,450
In this mode, the shape that is above the contents will be the main shape and below shapes will be

35
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,640
subtracted from the main shape.

36
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,190
You see, the circle is subtracted from the square.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
I sweep them.

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,730
Now the square is subtracted from the circle because the main shape is the circle now.

39
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,040
This was subtract mode.

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,290
The next one is intersect.

41
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,630
It keeps the intersected part of the shapes and removes the rest of the shapes.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,070
And the next one is exclude intersections, which is the opposite of the Intersect.

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,170
It removes the intersected part of the shapes and keeps the rest.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,770
You see here is empty and the rest of the shape is remained oc I explained Mayr's path generally.

45
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,280
Now let's start examples.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,750
The first example is two circles and a triangle.

47
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,610
I open content.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
You see?

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,480
Here is the circle here.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,600
I have made a triangle using polygon, a star.

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,320
You can increase or decrease its points from here.

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,620
And at last, we've made another circle.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,950
First of all, I hide the little circle and I want to merge these two shapes.

54
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,680
To do this, I click on content.

55
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,020
Select match path from modifiers.

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,580
You see, the circle and triangle are merged now.

57
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,210
If I move any of them, you can see the original shapes.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,430
After merging these two shapes.

59
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,230
Now I want to subtract this circle from these two shapes.

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,100
First of all, I should place the circle on their merge path.

61
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,920
Why?

62
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,530
Because modifiers affect on shapes that are placed above them.

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,070
I mean Poly star and outer lips.

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,390
To subtract this little circle from these two shapes, I should add another merge path.

65
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,450
We can add Mare's path from this menu, or we can duplicate this layer by pressing control D.

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,020
I moved the second marriage path below the inner ellipse.

67
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,020
Open it.

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,570
Click on subtract.

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,710
You see, the circle is subtracted from the previous shapes.

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,830
So we created this shape using two mesh patches.

71
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,190
Och, we made this locator.

72
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,480
This is the main plan that we want to add the locator to it.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,230
The main plan has such animation.

74
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,520
OC.

75
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,480
We want to animate this locator.

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,360
We wanted to enter the scene from top and stop at the point of the plan that we want.

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Position, said the anchor point here.

78
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,380
Make a keyframe for its scale.

79
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,900
After ten frames, create the second keyframe.

80
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,950
Go to the first keyframe and move the locater up.

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,390
Easy is the first two keyframes.

82
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,770
After the map completed.

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,180
We want the locators to calm down.

84
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,790
Move it back a bit.

85
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,830
It's slow.

86
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,700
I change the space between key frames to seven frames.

87
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,100
Good.

88
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,310
We want to animate its scale in y axis.

89
00:06:51,540 --> 00:07:00,570
Go five frames forward, decrease its wide scale after three frames, set it to 100 again.

90
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,850
Easy is the middle key frame.

91
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,080
Let's see the result.

92
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,050
When the locater is coming down, it should stretch a bit.

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,990
Now select scale.

94
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,610
Addicted, excited.

95
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,070
Let's have a look.

96
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,740
Said overshoot to ten and said bounce to 20.

97
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,950
This keyframes should go forward a bit to have better speed.

98
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,230
Now we want to make a way for it.

99
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,370
So I'll create an ellipse here.

100
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,000
Disable its stroke.

101
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,750
Change the field color to a darker one.

102
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,890
In Lake's path animate its size.

103
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,560
First of all, say the two zero, create a keyframe, go ten frames forward.

104
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,380
Easy is the second key frame.

105
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,530
Duplicate the clips.

106
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,490
Drag it down.

107
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,550
Move its key frame back.

108
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,490
Add match pass modifiers to it.

109
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,830
Said mesh path is mode to subtract.

110
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,060
The second ellipse should be higher.

111
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,190
It should be like this.

112
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,500
Open transformed property of the layer.

113
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,370
Decrease its wide scale to make it seem like 3D.

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,420
Now rename it.

115
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,490
Place it under the locator.

116
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,880
Exactly in a frame that the locater stands on the map.

117
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,650
This shape should be created.

118
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,090
Och, it's good.

119
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,840
Let's see the result.

120
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,360
All right.

121
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,230
It's good.

122
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,580
So let's go to the next example.

123
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,130
The next example is for learning to create complex shapes.

124
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,150
I have created a Polly Star here.

125
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,090
Let me hide these ones.

126
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,030
I have created a poly star.

127
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,890
Then a circle in it.

128
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,330
And a smaller circle and a more smaller one.

129
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,390
I want to merge these ones to create a gear.

130
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,650
For now, I hide these circles.

131
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,720
I want to match these two shapes together and just keep the intersected parts.

132
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,990
So I select the contents and add match path.

133
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:19,660
I move my path above these two circles to prevent it from applying to the below layers and be applied

134
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,100
to the above layers.

135
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,360
By default.

136
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,510
It merges these two shapes together.

137
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,650
But we just want their intersection.

138
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,780
So I select Intersect.

139
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,140
You see now just the intersection is shown.

140
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,820
I want to add the second circle to these.

141
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,150
So I duplicate Mare's path and move it below the circle.

142
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,490
Set its mode to add.

143
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,510
Up to this point.

144
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,340
This gear is created.

145
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,720
Duplicate Mary's path again and move it below the inner circle.

146
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,740
Said it's more to subtract to make it center empty.

147
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,670
You see, now we have a gear in polyester layer.

148
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,930
Change the values to change the gears shape.

149
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,100
Eventually you can animate it easily.

150
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,840
Now.

151
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,980
I'll make it Look.

152
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,650
Set this on offset to have continuous animation.

153
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,640
The next useful example that Maersk Path is used in it.

154
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,810
Is this what?

155
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,250
In these cases, you want to keep the black area of the eye inside the white area.

156
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,080
And also we use match path when we want to black part disappear while it exists.

157
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,340
The white area.

158
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,220
I hide the right eye.

159
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,170
Open the left eye layer.

160
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,230
We made the shape for its eyebrows, another one for this slight part of the eye.

161
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,600
Another one for the black part of the eye.

162
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,160
One for eyelashes.

163
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,830
And the last one for the white area.

164
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,850
As you see, we've made a simple animation for blinking.

165
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,940
We want to hide the black part of the eye when it blinks.

166
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,080
So we should animate it in a way that the black part be shown just in white area of the eye.

167
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,790
To do this, we should subtract the light from the black part of I.

168
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,190
We're going to create marriage path and place it under these two.

169
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,290
So in order to stop its affection and the shape of the eyebrow.

170
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,350
Press control g to group them.

171
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,090
Rename it to black group.

172
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,900
At marriage pass modifier in the group.

173
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,670
Delete its stroke, set its mode to subtract.

174
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,050
Light is above the black.

175
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,400
One should be above.

176
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,470
Change its color to black.

177
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,510
OC.

178
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,220
The black part is ready.

179
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,220
If it blinks, the problem is still shown.

180
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,420
To solve this problem, duplicate the shape of the white area of the eye.

181
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,510
You see, I have animated the path of the white area of the eye to make it seem like blinking.

182
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,020
Duplicate this shape.

183
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,150
Place it above this layer.

184
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,060
Now group the watch area of the I and black group press control G.

185
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,700
And another mesh path here.

186
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,330
Delete this stroke.

187
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,420
I want to keep the intersection of these two, which is the black area of the eye.

188
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,340
So I set the mode on Intersect.

189
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,080
It's all right.

190
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,150
Now, pay attention.

191
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,000
When I moved in to cater the black part of the.

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,310
I will hide completely.

193
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,390
It can also move.

194
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,480
The black part of the eye is in transform of the black.

195
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,910
If it is out of the white area of the eye, it won't be shown.

196
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,160
This is the animation of both eyes.

197
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,800
To learn how to animate the blinking of this eye.

198
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,910
We have full animation of this example at the end of the chapter.
