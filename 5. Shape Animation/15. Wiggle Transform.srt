1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay, let's talk about the next modifier which will transfer.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,150
I have created a shape layer inside it.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,110
I have created three template shapes.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,390
Now let's add wiggle transfer modifier to the contents.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,410
Open modifiers menu and select wiggle transfer.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,850
It creates some wiggle and random transforms for our shapes.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,590
Now if I play.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,450
Nothing will happen.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,380
Why?

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,970
Because in regard to transform and transform section, we should first change position, scale and rotation

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,940
in order to let the modifier animate the shape.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,830
For example, I said position x to ten and play it.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,580
You see these shapes wiggle in exposition.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,690
Let me change.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,860
It's my position.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,190
You see, they're moving in both X and Y position.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,800
Here we have eagles and we talked about that in wiggle path modifier.

18
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,590
It is the amount of wiggle per second.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,390
By that you can increase or decrease its speeds.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,850
The next one is correlation that we talked about in visual path modifier.

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,790
It is used to increase or decrease the amount of shaking of the vehicle.

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,740
I told you about temporal phase and a special phase by them.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,050
You can control your wiggles manually.

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,490
And random seed as its name applies.

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,950
It is used to change the random vehicle.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,950
This is transformed by this.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,980
You can control the vehicle happen in which properties position scale.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,210
As you see their scale is changing or rotation.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,560
You see, the rotation is also changing.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,950
Let me tell you a tip when we want to add another shape to the contents.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,710
So I click here and create it.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,870
Now you see, we got Transform is applied to this shape and its position.

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,930
Rotation and scale is changing like the other ones.

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,800
Now I want to create a multiplication sign.

35
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me disable wiggle modifier.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,060
I disable its feel.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,830
I enable wiggle transform to it.

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,940
You see this shape don't rotate from its center because its anchor point is almost at this point.

39
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,230
Let me select the shape you see.

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,290
It's anchor point is here.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,340
If I move the anchor point to the center, let me disable it, enable it again.

42
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,680
You see, nothing changed.

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,600
We cannot rotate this shape from the center using wiggle transfer.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,500
To help it.

45
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,450
It is better to use one of these template shapes.

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,550
Let me disable wiggle transfer.

47
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,990
Then convert it to busier path, then convert it to busier path and by editing the shape, create a

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,890
new one.

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,820
Now you see the shape transforms from its centre and it is no longer a concern.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,840
So it is better to make them from the template shapes and change it to the shape you want.

51
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,480
Now we know exactly what we call transform does.

52
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,350
So let's go to the examples in this example.

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,480
We want to create such a plan.

54
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,810
When the phone heats the ground, these shapes should come out of it and have such wiggle.

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,220
The animation of the shapes are made using wiggle transfer.

56
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,760
So let's go to the example.

57
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,520
We have such a plan and we want to animate these elements using visual transfer.

58
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:29,080
We drag the beginning of the layer to this point, appear this scale, create a keyframe here and go

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,730
to the second key frame of the page and create a second keyframe for a scale.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,100
Go back to the first keyframe and place the anchor point of the elements layer here.

61
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,890
It will scale from this point.

62
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,610
Then said the first scale frame on zero.

63
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,160
Now as we all transform to the elements.

64
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,890
Open Contents.

65
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,590
Select contents and add visual transform to.

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,800
Now, said Weagle second on one.

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,970
Said exposition on ten.

68
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,830
And said the Y position on ten.

69
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,200
Says rotation on 50 and set the scale on ten.

70
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,680
Let's have a look.

71
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,200
As you see, when we add, we will transform to these elements.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,170
Some problems occur since we will transform wiggles every shapes separately.

73
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,810
Therefore, the shapes have a mess here.

74
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,460
To prevent this mess.

75
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,210
We move, we will transform above these two groups.

76
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,290
So the we shall transform won't be applied to this happy face.

77
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,520
And this like it.

78
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,230
As you see, seems the anchor point of this heart is here and it is rotating around it.

79
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,840
It is not correct.

80
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,460
So to solve this, I disable vehicle transfer.

81
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
Select contents.

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,960
And then I use the rectangle shape and create a square here.

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,530
After that, we convert it to busier path to change its path.

84
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,690
Then I edit the shape again.

85
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,760
Then we change its name.

86
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,550
Let me change its feel.

87
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,220
Now we delete the previous heart.

88
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,560
Enable the vehicle transform again.

89
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,770
As you see, the heart is rotating and moving around its own center and it is not moving this way.

90
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,450
Now, how should I add, will transform to these groups.

91
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,780
The open sticker group transfer position.

92
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,270
And here we use wiggle expression.

93
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,580
As you see, it moves as well.

94
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,620
So to apply the same thing for its rotation, we paste this to the rotation, so we increase the frequency

95
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,400
a bit.

96
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,040
We do the same thing with like.

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,910
We apply it to the rotation to.

98
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,570
Let's have a look to see how is the animation now?

99
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,660
Now we apply a side to this scale to be softer.

100
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,910
It's okay now.
