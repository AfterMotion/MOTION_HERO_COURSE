1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,350
The next modifier is train path.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,060
We have created such notification and we have animated in this way.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,630
Now we want to animate this circle and these lines using tree path.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,160
Open shape player.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,550
Open contents.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,170
First of all, we want the circle to create.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,750
So click on ellipse and add train path modifier to eight.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,390
Now open the modifier layer.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,470
The first option is a start.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,210
By this option, you can remove the shape from the beginning point of the shape.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,140
And end means this will happen from the ending point.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,960
I've said is used for moving the shape you have created.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,350
As you see, you can easily move this area using a set parameter.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,440
I create a simple animation for this circle.

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,710
I said the start on 100 to hide the stroke in the beginning.

16
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,360
After ten frames, I set it to zero to appear completely.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,610
Let's have a look.

18
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,230
As you see, when the train path is applying, it is applied on the field as well.

19
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,710
This makes the animation an interesting.

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,640
To prevent this, we duplicate the ellipse.

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,290
The light train path and a stroke of the upper one.

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,610
Move it.

23
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,260
Benioff La Swan.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,700
Gillette, Phil and Philip Swann.

25
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,740
Now, when the stroke is animating, the circle won't look uninteresting.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,750
Its animation is a bit fast.

27
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,280
I set the second keyframe on one second.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,200
Let's see.

29
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,060
It's a little slow.

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,530
Set it on 20 frames and easy is both key frames.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,410
It's OC.

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,610
I want to make the stroke corners smoother.

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,000
So I open a stroke and select round cap.

34
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,950
Now we should animate these lines.

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,940
In order to animate these lines with one train path.

36
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,580
Select all three of them.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,580
Press control g to move them inside the group.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,520
At the train path for this group.

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,460
Now we should animate the start.

40
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,530
You see, the layers are animating in this direction.

41
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,510
We want them to animate in the opposite direction.

42
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,240
So we use and all three lines are now animating at the same time.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,860
But we don't want this.

44
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,430
We want this line to be animated, first of all, and then this line and finally, this one.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,990
Therefore in three multiple shapes.

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,240
You should select individually.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,300
Now you see the lines are animating from the third line, but we don't want that and we want them to

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,970
animate from upper lines.

49
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,220
So we should change the order of the shapes.

50
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,590
That's okay now.

51
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,150
When the notification reaches this point, we create a keyframe for any parameter, and after 30 frames

52
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,070
we set it on 100.

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,260
Easy is its key frames.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,900
Let's have a look.

55
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,990
OC You can create such an animation using three path.

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,000
Another thing that you should learn is that if you want to start from this point.

57
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,630
You should open shape and open lips of the stroke.

58
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,350
And right click on its ellipse path and convert it to busier path to be able to see its point.

59
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,930
Select the point that you want the train path to be animated from there.

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
Right click and from Mask and Shape Path.

61
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,240
Select Set first where Text.

62
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,690
Now you see, the start point of the animation will be from that point.

63
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
Look at here.

64
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,830
The next example is this one that you can create for the growth of the plans.

65
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,690
We want to remake it.

66
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,440
So to create this, we go to the end of the animation and select the stem of the planter.

67
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,870
Disable the keyframes of the three path.

68
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,490
Delete the train path modifiers which are applied.

69
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,900
They say, well, the animation of the Last Circle as well.

70
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,370
Go to the last key frame in which the circle is completed and yellow trim path.

71
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,350
Okay.

72
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,100
Now simply create a trim path in the contents of the circle.

73
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,000
The stroke.

74
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,860
Zooming then from the frame that the seed enters the circle.

75
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,700
Exactly.

76
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,640
From here it should start animating.

77
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,590
Open stream path.

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Create a key frame for its starter.

79
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,000
Go to any frames forward and set it to 100.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,420
Select two key frames and apply time.

81
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,580
Reverse keyframe to reverse it.

82
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,610
Easy is both of the key frames.

83
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,740
Move the keyframes back a bit.

84
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,310
Good.

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,120
When the circle completed, we start animating the stem of the plant.

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,410
Open this down layer contents base.

87
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,040
This is the main shape of this term of this plant.

88
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,130
Then instead of adding a train path here, I copy this one.

89
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,310
Click on the base and press control V.

90
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,760
Then we open three paths and increase keyframes distance.

91
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,370
Exactly the amount of camera movements.

92
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,340
Move the key frame here.

93
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,640
The first key frame of the camera is here.

94
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,670
Move the first key frame of the train path here.

95
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,710
Said.

96
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,290
The second key frame of the circle here in order to start the animation of this time of the plant as

97
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,220
it finishes.

98
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,400
Now why this term of the plant is animating, the camera is moving as well.

99
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,540
It moves until here.

100
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,220
Here.

101
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,920
This demo of the flower should be created.

102
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,890
So we copy this train path.

103
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Select this shape and press control V.

104
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,410
Open the shape.

105
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,430
After 20 frames.

106
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,830
Move this key frame here.

107
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,680
Let's see.

108
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:47,840
Good.

109
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,570
The next shape is this one.

110
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,630
Now, you should animate this one.

111
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,790
These are the rest of the shapes.

112
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,090
Copy this train path again.

113
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Select the next shape and press control v.

114
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,870
Go forward.

115
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
This is the next shape.

116
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,310
So like this.

117
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,290
Control, we go forward.

118
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,290
This is the next shape.

119
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,790
Select this control V.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,060
We go up there and this shape.

121
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,540
Press control V.

122
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,010
Let's see.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,010
As you see, when the main stem reaches to the stem of the flowers, their animation begins.

124
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,700
And after that, the animation of the flowers starts.

125
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,700
Sometimes it happens to start from the end point like this.

126
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,560
To solve this, click on the Reverse Path button.

127
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,730
Okay, let's have a look.

128
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,200
To learn how to animate the hands and bushes around the scene.

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,660
Follow us to the end of this chapter.

130
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,310
This example was one of the most useful ways using tree path.

131
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,590
Good luck.
