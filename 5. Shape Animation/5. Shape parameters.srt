1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,140
In this lesson.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,530
We're going to talk about the rest of the shape parameters.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,650
First of all, I create a rectangle.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,940
The first parameter is content.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,400
In front of this parameter.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,710
There is an option called ADD, which was also here.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,870
By adoption, you can add some functions to this content.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,810
I click on this triangle and menu will open.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,660
The first one is group.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,420
By this it can create group and put layers in it.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,110
I have rectangle, ellipse, Alley Star and path.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,040
I click on ellipse you see an ellipse created.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,970
Ollie's Star makes a star.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,410
And in this section you can create field, stroke, gradient feel and gradient stroke for the shape.

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,230
And from here you can create modifiers for shape.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,620
We will explain them in the next session.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,570
When you open content, there is a rectangle and it's very small.

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,740
In the rectangle I have fill and a stroke I have explained about before I open the rectangle path.

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,500
It can change its size.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,870
The difference between size and scale is that if you increase the scale, the strokes thickness will

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,190
increase as well.

22
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,860
But when you increase the size, the stroke thickness won't change.

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,460
By this parameter, it can change the position of the shape, and by the next parameter you can change

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,130
the roundness of the corners of the shape.

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,390
This parameter reverses the path.

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,600
To explain it more.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,950
I added train pass modifier and place it on their feline stroke.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,250
I don't feel for now.

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,750
A stroke is enough.

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,850
I animate a start.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,360
You see, it starts animating from this point.

32
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:16,210
If I want the animation to start in this direction, I should click on this icon and you see its direction

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,150
changes so it reverses the path.

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,600
So this option reverses the path direction.

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,590
I delete this.

36
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,050
I enable field.

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,320
I place it here.

38
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,330
I create a rounded rectangle.

39
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,420
Open it up.

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,980
Rectangle path.

41
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,510
Rounded rectangle has the same parameters that the rectangle had.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,410
The only difference is that the roundness is set on 65 while it was zero for rectangle.

43
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,650
I don't this.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,100
The next one is El.

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,360
I create an ellipse and open it.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,140
Slager.

47
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,490
Here.

48
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,770
I just have size and position.

49
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,470
The next one is Polygon Open Poly Star Path.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,790
As you see here, I have different parameters from type.

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,070
You can select Polygon or a star.

52
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,950
Point defines the size of the shape.

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,950
We know our position and rotation.

54
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,480
Outer radius is for its size.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,450
Outer roundness softens the corners.

56
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,270
The next one is a star.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,700
I don't need to create a star.

58
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,600
Just I go to the poly star path and change the type.

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,560
You see, the parameters changed in a radius, which changes the inner radius of the star.

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,350
How the radius is four wings length.

61
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,330
In there.

62
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,440
Roundness is for softness of the inner corners of the star.

63
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,270
Outer roundness is for the softness of the outer corners, and I have explained the other parameters

64
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,990
before.

65
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,990
The important point to say here is that every shape has its own transformed parameter.

66
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,120
By which you can apply individual changes to any shape.

67
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,270
And in spite of the fact that every shape has its own transformed parameter, every layer has a separate

68
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,680
transform parameter.

69
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,810
You see, when I change the position, both shapes move together.

70
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,560
When I rotate it, both shapes rotate together.

71
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,770
This helps you have more control on the shapes.

72
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,030
For example, I drag it here, make a keyframe, and at the second one, it comes here.

73
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,450
This shape moves.

74
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,540
I want to rotate the poly star while moving.

75
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,160
They shape, layer moves, and meanwhile the police are rotate.

76
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,920
You can do the same thing for this square.

77
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,320
I create a keyframe for position of the rectangle in time line.

78
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,970
After half of a second, I drag it up.

79
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,930
At second one, I paste the first keyframe here to move the rectangle down again.

80
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,780
Finally, I got this animation.
