1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,690
The next modifier we will talk about is wiggle path.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,780
I have created a stroke here.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,120
At the wiggle path to the shape.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,580
Their shape gets a bit rougher.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,120
Open legal path.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,850
We have some parameters here.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,880
The first one is size that lets you control the size of these vibrations.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,660
The next parameter is detail, which lets you increase or decrease the amount of these vibrations.

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,600
You see, I increase and decrease them.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:47,080
The next parameter is point that makes the points of these vibrations sharp or smooth.

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,320
I set it on corner for now.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,740
The next parameter is wiggle second, which shows you the amount of the wiggle per second.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,680
For example, now it is set on two.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,210
I change it to ten.

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,550
You see, it is now so quick.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,890
I change it back to two.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,220
The next one is correlation.

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,980
It is the relation between two things.

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,540
It controls the resemblance of the movements of the points which are next to each other.

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:30,080
If we decrease it to something like ten, the similarity of motion of points which are next to each

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,360
other will decrease so much, and accordingly we will have more vibration.

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,840
And if we increase it to something like 97, the similarity of motion of the points which are next to

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,610
each other will be the same.

24
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,260
Therefore, we will have less vibrations and we will have smooth movements.

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,060
I reset it to 50 again.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,060
The next parameter is temporal phase.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,090
It is used to animate the wiggle manually.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,720
Now if I play, it wiggles randomly.

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,690
For example, in second one.

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,760
I don't want it to be like this.

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,520
I want it to be like this.

32
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,500
To do this, I use this parameter.

33
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,050
For example, in the beginning I said we go second to zero.

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,080
You see, when I play it, we won't have animation anymore.

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:30,140
I create a keyframe for temporal phase, and at the second one, I want such a situation to be created.

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,880
I created this manually.

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,200
And if I want to stop it, I can do it using this parameter.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,690
The next parameter is spatial phase, which is exactly like temporal phase.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,440
The difference between these two is a bit technical.

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,010
Temporal phase moves the ways in horizontal direction.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,870
I mean a long x axis.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,070
The spatial phase moves the waves along the y axis.

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,190
They are usually used to apply changes manually.

44
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,660
Random speed is also used to make the waves of the shape random.

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,370
Now let's go to the examples.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,060
We want to create this animation.

47
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,980
You see, as the charger connects to the phone, these waves are created by wiggle path.

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,610
We want to create this animation now.

49
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,170
I deleted the wiggle passes of the shapes to create them again and have the same waves.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,850
We want to make this line around the phone to wiggle, just as the charger cable connects to the phone.

51
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,060
So we enter the mobile layer shake.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,630
It is the layer of the line around the phone.

53
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,230
I had a visual path to it.

54
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,780
Now I create a keyframe for the size of the wiggle path.

55
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:20,160
Press You return back to the frame that the charger cable is disconnected from the mobile and set the

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,510
size to zero.

57
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,690
I play to see the result.

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,730
The animation of this line is not synchronized with the animation of the wiggle of the mobile.

59
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,770
So open the shape and set its regal second to ten.

60
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,310
Let's see.

61
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,600
Good.

62
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,750
I disable vehicle path for now.

63
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,400
Note that here I have created a path with some points which have the same distance from each other to

64
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,960
have synchronized vehicle.

65
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,520
But if the points didn't have same distance from each other, the Wiggles would be like this.

66
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,690
And they're not good.

67
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,000
So pay attention while creating a shape.

68
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,120
You should have points with same distance in order to have same visual pathways.

69
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,520
I copy wiggle path.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,070
Open a screen layer.

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,370
I want to add, we go to the green circle.

72
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,150
Open green layer.

73
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,100
Press Control V.

74
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Let me see.

75
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,650
Where are the keyframes?

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,110
I should move to keyframes here.

77
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,880
All right.

78
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,990
It's Miguel is okay.

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
Just I think it's details are not sufficient.

80
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,630
So I increase its details.

81
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,430
It's good.

82
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,790
We should create Miguel for this line, too.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,110
So I copy.

84
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,040
Miguel path.

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,020
Open line.

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
In this frame that the first key frame is set.

87
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,930
Select the line and press control V.

88
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,030
Let's see.

89
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,120
Good.

90
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,820
Price you to see the keyframes.

91
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,910
Wriggle is applied from here until here.

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,860
Just framed the mobile doesn't have wiggle anymore.

93
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,400
And the charger is disconnected from the mobile.

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,090
So we should copy the keyframes of the visual path here.

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,470
Copy of these two Control V.

96
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,560
And reverse.

97
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,010
We should do the same with the vehicle path of the line around the mobile.

98
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,280
Copy paste.

99
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,520
Reverse.

100
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,320
Let's have a look.

101
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,560
OC.

102
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,040
This was another usage of visual path by which you can create such waves.
