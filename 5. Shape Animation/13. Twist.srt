1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,570
The next modifier we will talk about is taste.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,340
I have created a line here and I will apply to it straight.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,040
As I add the modifier, as you see, the line starts twisting.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,480
This modifier is used to twist a shapes open the modifier.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,010
The first parameter is angle by which it can define the amount of this twist.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,510
The next parameter is center that determines the axis of twisting.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,560
I change its exposition and place it here.

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,780
So I increase its value in x axis until here and decrease its angle.

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, if I scale down the shape and place its anchor point here.

10
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,220
You can create this shape.

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,560
Let's go to the examples.

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,880
We can create such a shapes using this modifier.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,220
I start with this one.

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,970
Open the candy group.

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,170
And open the twist group.

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,670
I have created this using twist.

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,750
I delighted.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,170
I have created this stroke here.

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,120
At the Tour street.

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,730
If I increase the angle a bit, this spiral will happen in the center of this shape.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,650
But we don't want this.

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,010
We want the center of this spiral to be here.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,410
So I increase the y axis of the terrorist until it's n placed exactly here I increased the amount of

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,400
the terrorist.

25
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,600
Move with a bit upper.

26
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,630
As you see, we can create shapes like this so easily.

27
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,520
The next example we created with Twist is this one.

28
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,260
Open the share player.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,000
Contents.

30
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,300
Open the candy group and then peace.

31
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,280
Here we have created this using two modifiers to east and repeater.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,550
Repeater is used to repeat these and twist is for twisting this shape to remake it.

33
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,560
Ideally, twist and repeater.

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,140
I have created a circle in the beginning and I have cropped this shape from it.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,710
Then I have added this modifier to it.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,030
After I add to its modifier, I select a piece group and add repeater modifiers to it.

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,780
Often repeat their change its value to four.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,170
Change its exposition to zero.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,190
Then set the rotation parameter to 90 to have the same distance from each other.

40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,640
Then open to us and adjust its center to turn into the shape that we want.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,930
Seems good.

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,720
OC As you see, we created such a shape using two and repeater modifiers.
