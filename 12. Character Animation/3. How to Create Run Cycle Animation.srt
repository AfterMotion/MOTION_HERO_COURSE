00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,010
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,470
And this.

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,280
Listen, I want to create a run cycle animation for the character.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,400
You may think running is the same as working with more speed, but in fact, it's not the case.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,280
Because if you take a look at the running poses, you see that one of the main poses of running the

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,540
legs are in the air and there is no contact with the ground while in walking.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,510
The character's leg is always touching the ground and in no pose, the character is separated from the

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,190
ground to create their own cycle.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,430
I open the Work cycle project.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,710
First I have to delete the controller's keyframe and then start animating again.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
This expression morning is for values.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,980
I have looked them.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,680
To remove this warning, I just need to disable these expressions.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,460
Well, I hide the layers.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,790
I don't need to lighten the scene and animate the character easier.

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,120
I put the character in a straight form to create poses more precise.

17
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,820
It's good.

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,030
As you remember, to create a work cycle, I needed 25 frames, which means one second.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,310
But because the wrong cycle is faster, I use 16 frames to create a.

20
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,200
I trim the worker here, delete the markers I don't need.

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,780
And only keep up and down poses.

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,020
Well, I opened the reference and as you see, running poses are similar to walking.

23
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,120
It starts from the contact post in which the right leg is in front.

24
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,190
In the second contact, the left leg is in front and in the middle.

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:30,210
The passing pose is located between the contact and pass poses is the down pose and between the pass

26
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,160
and contact is the opposite.

27
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,240
Here, I don't need to start from contact poses as I did before.

28
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,060
Then passing pose and then up and down poses.

29
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,170
So I start with up and down poses because I can edit the controllers movement path using motion path

30
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,810
and I don't need to create all the poses.

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,540
Let's get to work and see what they mean.

32
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,530
I put the outpost for the first pose, so the last pose is going to be the pose as well.

33
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,190
The middle of these two poses, which is frame edge should be the opposed to.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,740
Between two opposes.

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,570
The down should be placed.

36
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,440
In this post, the character's body goes a little higher almost here.

37
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,700
And as you see, this is the outpost.

38
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,480
The right leg forms like this and the left one like this.

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,750
And the distance from the ground is almost the same.

40
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,620
So I select the right click, bring it back.

41
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,540
Its rotation is like this and bring the front leg forward.

42
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,910
An ankle rotation is like this.

43
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,420
I put a ruler to bring both legs to the same height.

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,800
The first post of the OP is created, I create keyframes for the position and rotation of the layers.

45
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,700
Here, the body must be rotated forward.

46
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,300
So I put it on ten.

47
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,660
I go to the last post and have to paste these keyframes here.

48
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,220
To do so, I go to the puzzle in the animation section, copy the keyframes, and then click on the

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,120
paste button.

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,740
I go to the middle of post and reverse the legs.

51
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,530
The next post to create is the downpours.

52
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,130
As it's shown here, the character's body is at its lowest.

53
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,940
Let's take this form the back leg in the oppo stakes.

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,910
A support role for the body in the down pose.

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,790
So in the outpost, this is the back leg and must take a support role.

56
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,730
So I bring it down and also the body comes down almost in this position.

57
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,150
I zero the rotation and bring the leg lower.

58
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,650
Bring the body a little more down.

59
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,710
The other leg takes this position.

60
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,040
And in rotation like this.

61
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,460
Also the rotation of the body should increase.

62
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,620
I put it on 20.

63
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,090
I go on the next town post and create a reverse of this position for the links.

64
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,670
I copy and paste body control keyframes for the first down post here.

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,940
I zero this rotation and put it on the ground.

66
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,820
This other leg should be like this.

67
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,050
Let's have a look, see how it is.

68
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,300
The running animation has been created, but it's not attractive.

69
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,540
That's because I need to adjust the controllers path.

70
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,490
To do that, isolate the pencil and create such a path for the controller.

71
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,420
After in the pads, you see that the leg movements are better.

72
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,930
After that, I go for the easing of the keyframes.

73
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,660
First isolate body keyframes.

74
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,660
Easy, easy for them.

75
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,780
Go to the graph editor and where the character comes down on the ground.

76
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:10,100
Like here, the speed needs to be increased and where the character is in its opposition, the speed

77
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,510
needs to be decreased.

78
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,540
So I decrease the speed in these poses.

79
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,230
Let's see how it looks.

80
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,320
To increase the speed of these keyframes.

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,580
I select them and I go through each vessel in animation and increase their speed by this slider a little.

82
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,790
I put it on 70.

83
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,360
Let's see how it looks.

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,780
After the same speed I created for the body position keyframes I need to create for the controllers

85
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,700
and body rotation to.

86
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,720
Okay to do so, I select keyframes.

87
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,370
Easy.

88
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,980
Then select keyframes related to the post.

89
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,250
And set them on 70.

90
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,860
Well, let's have a look and see how it is.

91
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,810
As you see, it's much better.

92
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,670
I can also increase animation speed in the poses to improve it.

93
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,380
Much better.

94
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,490
Now I go to animate the hands.

95
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,810
I make the hand layers visible.

96
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,700
To animate the hands in the wrong cycle.

97
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,900
I need to use FCW so I create a keyframe for the upper lower and goal for the right hand controller

98
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,030
and do the same for the left hand.

99
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:50,930
I select controllers press you to see the keyframes here, where the right leg is in the back.

100
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,420
The right hand should be in front of here.

101
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,230
And the left hand should be behind first.

102
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,820
I just left hand.

103
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,770
And then turn it backwards.

104
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,440
I placed these keyframes on the last post.

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,350
In the middle oppose and should be reversed.

106
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,600
Isolate these keyframes and ease them.

107
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,580
Let's see how it is.

108
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,850
For the hand parts to have overlap animation isolate these key frames and bring them to frames forward.

109
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,610
Let's go for animating the head.

110
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,950
I make the head controller visible.

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,510
Here I create a key frame in the Opposed.

112
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,220
It should turn backward.

113
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,950
I put it on minus seven.

114
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,710
And in the downpours in the forward interaction.

115
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,520
Seven I think it's better to increase it here a little.

116
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,510
Here again, I paste the post keyframe.

117
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,780
Here, though.

118
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,420
And again here up then I easy's the key frames.

119
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,660
And bring keyframes to frames forward to have overlap animation.

120
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,750
After doing this, I can enable loop expression to see the character animation with the background.

121
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,150
I increase the work area and hide the controllers to see how is the animation?

122
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,580
The animation is good.

123
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,840
I make the scene layers visible.

124
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,330
Let's see.

125
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,380
How is the work?

126
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,920
I can increase the background speed a bit.

127
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,660
Isolate the null object.

128
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:33,080
Press edgewise to open its expression and 700 free speed to increase.

129
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,010
To make the background continuous.

130
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,660
I can select this layer first control DX and bring it here.

131
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
Same for this one.

132
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
It's good.

133
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,060
I can also increase the speed on seven.

134
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,170
I do the same for these two lives later.

135
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,560
And at the end I can also harmonize the character animation and its shadow.

136
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,660
Well here.

137
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,440
This key frame should be placed and then down this keyframe.

138
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,160
Here.

139
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,360
The shadow needs to be small and in the downpours it should be bigger.

140
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,090
And here it should be a small.

141
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,780
And the speed of the opposed keyframes of the shadow needs to be on 70 to move with the character.

142
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay.

143
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,710
It's good.

144
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,220
If you wanted to get familiar with the script completely and know all of the uses of options and the

145
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,700
way of working with them in reading and animating the character, I recommend you to watch Derek and

146
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,400
animate the character in due course.

147
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,880
Because there I had explained all of the tools and options and the usage of them completely, and it

148
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,510
can be so useful for those who want to follow the characters, drink and animate professionally.

149
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,590
Good luck.
