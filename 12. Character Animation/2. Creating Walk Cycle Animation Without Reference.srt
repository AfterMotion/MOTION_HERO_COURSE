00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,110
In this video, I want to talk about the three main and important principles of creating cycle animation

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,310
that usually are inside of the bubble so that you won't be needing to use them, for instance, while

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,790
creating such animations all the time.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,090
Firstly, you have to animate the body and move it up and down.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,910
If I want to show you more precisely, it has such a movement path.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,980
Secondly, the movement path of the foot controller should be like this.

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,450
And finally, to have a real and overlapping movement for the hands, you have to use f k instead of

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,020
k.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,290
So let's see how to do this practically.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,620
The first thing you should know is that they've already reached the character using the expression two.

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:02,700
It's also good to mention that I've set the frame rate of the count to 24 frames so that the whole lifecycle

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,170
animation will happen within 24 frames or just one second.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,080
As you can see, I've specified the work cycle process by markers.

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,810
Every pose is three frames apart from the next pulse.

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,770
The first principle about work cycle animation that you need to know is the body of the character has

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,460
an up and down movement.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,940
So for creating such movement, I hide the controllers that I don't need.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,580
Then I open the position of the body and then I separate it in the pose.

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,650
I move the body up a little.

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,150
Then I create a keyframe for the y position of the body.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,830
In the down pose.

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,210
I lower it down.

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:54,420
I make these key frames eases and for the next down and opposes, I duplicate these key frames.

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,380
And in order to create keyframes for the contact poses, I go to the second content and create a keyframe

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,150
for the oil position and put it for the first and last contact poses.

27
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,690
And I make them linear so there wouldn't be any pause for the beginning and end of the animation.

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,510
The body should be like this.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,150
Let me hide the arms and like layers.

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,530
As you can see, the body should move like this.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,340
The next thing that you need to pay attention to is that when the body is in the contact pose, it would

32
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,310
slightly move forward in the past, impose it back to its initial position.

33
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,860
And I duplicate these two key frames for the next passing and contact poses.

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,010
Then I made them easy.

35
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,580
Ease.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,710
The movement path of the body should be like this.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,680
Now let's move on to body rotation.

38
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,860
The body rotates forward when it reaches the contact post.

39
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,350
So I set it to two and create a keyframe for it.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,420
In the passing post.

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,620
It should be zero.

42
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,360
Then I make the keyframes easy.

43
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,910
Ease.

44
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,300
And in order to create an overlap in action, I moved the rotation key frames backward.

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,740
Then I look at.

46
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,480
I looked at other ones as well.

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,560
After animating the body, it's time for the second principle or making the movement path of the legs.

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,730
For doing so, I unhide the right leg of the character.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,410
As you can see, the movement path of the leg controllers should be like this.

50
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,430
For doing so, I open the position of this controller.

51
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,670
And the first contact post should look like this.

52
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,830
In the second contact pause, the leg moves backward.

53
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,550
And in the last contact post, I duplicate the first key frames here.

54
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,120
In this second passing post, the leg moves up.

55
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:46,020
Basically, I just made a triangular path like this for the controller of the leg, and I made the path

56
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,740
curved.

57
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,170
In the downpours.

58
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,540
The rotation of the lake should be zero.

59
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,670
It should be like this here.

60
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,210
After that, I made the keyframes of the contact process eases.

61
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,930
I copy these keyframes and paste them for the position and rotation of the left leg controller.

62
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,470
Then I move the keyframes back.

63
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,280
So the last keyframes would be for the second contact post.

64
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,780
In the outpost.

65
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,600
The body is slightly upward than it should be.

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,610
So I just select the outpost keyframes and move the body down a little bit.

67
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,580
Okay.

68
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,630
After animating the legs, it's time for the third principle, or using f k for animating the arms,

69
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,120
not k for doing so.

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,830
Isolate the controller of the right arm and disable the IP option so now I can animate it using f k

71
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,390
in the f k section.

72
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,980
Individual control.

73
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:33,900
I create keyframes for the upper lower and go in the first contact where the right leg is a hit.

74
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:41,910
The right arm should place behind and in the next contact where the right leg is behind the right arm

75
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,920
should be forward.

76
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,840
I make the keyframes easy.

77
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,450
Ease.

78
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,720
Then I looked them.

79
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,010
And in order to create an overlap in action, I move them like this and place the last contact keyframes

80
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,300
for the first one.

81
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,190
I copy these same keyframes and paste them for the right hand as well.

82
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,830
They should be like this.

83
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,220
This should be exactly the opposite of the right hand.

84
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,640
Okay.

85
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,000
After that, we can also animate the head.

86
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,260
For doing so in the contact poses where the character lands on his front leg, the head rotates a little

87
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,070
bit down.

88
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,600
I set it to five and in the passing post it should be zero.

89
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,630
Then I make the keyframes eases, and for overlapping action, I move them back and loop them all.

90
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,670
Now that I'm finished animating the character, it's time for animating the background.

91
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,320
To do.

92
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,740
So I create keyframes for the position of this shape.

93
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,990
It should be here at the beginning of the timeline.

94
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,250
And after a couple of frames, I wanted to be here.

95
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,340
I animate this line to.

96
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,390
I make this line look like this so it would look like it's in perspective.

97
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,350
Let's see how it turned out.

98
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,240
In the 6 seconds.

99
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,960
I moved the last keyframes right here to increase the number of fences.

100
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,740
I use the effects.

101
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,370
Let's see how it looks.

102
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:48,250
I move the second keyframes at the beginning of the timeline, and in the second six I increase the

103
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,180
number.

104
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,930
After that, let's work on animating the three.

105
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,920
First, I create a keyframe for its position since the tree is located in the back.

106
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,690
Speed should be relatively slower.

107
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,660
I go to the second eight.

108
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,500
I create a keyframe for it.

109
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,280
For the first keyframe.

110
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,910
I move the tree out of the scene and for the second keyframe, I move it right here.

111
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,800
Let's see how it looks.

112
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,300
In the second six, I duplicated the three layer.

113
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,290
I put the ruler here.

114
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,250
So the location of the tree is obvious at the end of the animation.

115
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:44,450
I go to the beginning of the timeline and move the second tree right here so the loop would work correctly.

116
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,800
And once this tree goes out of the scene, I trim the layer.

117
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
Now let's animate this song.

118
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,550
Let's see how it turned out.

119
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,720
Let me make a shadow for the character as well.

120
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,150
As you can see, the lob works perfectly and there is no problem while repeating.

121
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,860
Good luck.
