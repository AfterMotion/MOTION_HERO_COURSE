00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,220
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,940
In this video, I want to talk about how you can create a simple run cycle animation for your character.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,810
The run cycle is relatively faster than the work cycle, so I'm going to create the run cycle animation

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,720
in 16 frames just like before.

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,450
Here I'm going to apply the same three principles that I worked on for the work cycle.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,540
However, in the run cycle, the up and down movement of the body is much more than before.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,280
And also it's faster.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,510
What's more, the movement path of the food controller is different.

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,380
Without any further ado, let's start.

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:55,400
Initially, I work on animating the body, isolate its controller and open its position.

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,870
Then I separate it.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,700
And I saw animals in the Y position in the down pose.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,530
The body moves lower.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,400
I create a key frame for it in the outpost.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,150
It moves up and I make these two key frames eases.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,170
And for the next up and down poses, I duplicate them.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,100
And to create a keyframe for the contact post, I go to the second contact post and create a keyframe

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,400
and put it for the first and last contact poses.

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,270
As you can see, the body should move like this.

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,470
Now it's time to animate in the x position.

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,650
In the passing pose, I create a keyframe for it and in the contact post, the body should move a little

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,380
forward.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,790
Then I copy the keyframes and paste them right here.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,360
Then I make them easy.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,730
All right.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,210
Now it's time to work on the rotation.

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,020
In the passing post, I create a key frame for it and set it to nine.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,530
In the context post.

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:09,940
I set it to 14, then I make them easy, easy and duplicate them for the next passing and contact poses.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,850
And to create overlapping movements.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,190
I move the keyframes backwards.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,390
Then I look them.

33
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,100
Now let's work on animating the head.

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,650
I opened its rotation in the passing pose.

35
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,420
I create the key frame for it, and in the contact post I set it to seven.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,300
I duplicate the same key frames for the next passing and contact poses.

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,210
Then I make them easy, easy, and I move them back just to create the overlapping movement.

38
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,300
Then I look at.

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,070
Let me hide the arms and the left leg so I can focus on animating the right leg.

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,070
Isolate the right controller and open its position and rotation.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,380
In the contact post, I create a keyframe for its position and move it forward so the right leg would

42
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,000
be completely stretched.

43
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,820
I create a key frame for its rotation.

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,120
In the passing post.

45
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,320
The link should be located in the back.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,680
And the rotation should be like this.

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,490
In the concept post, it should look like this.

48
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,200
And the next person post.

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,700
It should be like this.

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,730
In the outpost.

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
It should be here.

52
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,990
And for the last contact, I duplicate the first keyframes.

53
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,210
In the down pose.

54
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,040
I move it lower a little bit.

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,210
And right here.

56
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,530
In the contact post.

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,940
I moved back a little.

58
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,860
Basically, we must create a path like this for the controller in the outpost.

59
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,120
It must be here.

60
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,130
In the down post.

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,720
It should look like this.

62
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,500
After doing so, I curve the path.

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,980
Let's see how it turns out.

64
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,370
I just have to change the rotation right here.

65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,680
Right here.

66
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,900
The rotation should look like this.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,000
And over here, I rotated like this.

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,550
And also, it should be up here a little.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,390
Then I make them Yeezys.

70
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,290
I copied the keyframes and paste them for the rotation and position of the left leg controller.

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,360
I can.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,730
The left leg.

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,950
Then I look the keyframes.

74
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,860
I move the left leg controller back.

75
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,610
So the last keyframes would be placed on the second contact.

76
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,390
Well, let's go for animating the arms.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,810
Firstly, I make the arms visible.

78
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,420
Then isolate the right arm controller.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:21,050
Then in the effects control section, I create keyframes for the upper lower and go in the first contact.

80
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,900
The right hand should be the opposite of the right leg.

81
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,580
So I move it backward.

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,400
In the next contact, I move it forward and in the last contact I duplicate the first keyframes and

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,410
make them easy.

84
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,390
Let's see what it looks like.

85
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,120
The first concert.

86
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,830
I moved up a little.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,490
And for the overlapping movements, I move the keyframes like this.

88
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,190
And then I look at the hand animation.

89
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,130
I put the keyframes like this.

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,480
Then isolate these keyframes and then copy and paste them for the other hand.

91
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,030
Isolate upper, lower and goal and press control V and move them like this.

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,810
So the left hand would be exactly the opposite of the right hand.

93
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,830
Now let's work on animating the shadow.

94
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,240
All right.

95
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,030
Let's check what it looks like.

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,110
Very well.

97
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:04,730
I can hide the background layers and expand the work area to 2 seconds, and let's see how it came out.

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,360
The animation of the right leg is sloped.

99
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,220
So I have to loop it.

100
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,090
I do the same for the body.

101
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,640
As you can see, the run cycle animation is done and everything is looked.

102
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,610

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,540
And finally, if you want completely to learn reading and animating the character by the basil and also

104
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,560
to get acquainted with other tools that are very useful in raking and animating the character, I suggest

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,970
you watch this video.
