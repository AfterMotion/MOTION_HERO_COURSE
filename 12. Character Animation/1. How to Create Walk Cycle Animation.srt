00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,450
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,960
In this lesson, I want to talk about creating a work cycle animation for my character.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,530
As you recall, I created this animation with the work cycle tool automatically, but in this lesson

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,300
I want to create work in animation manually.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,150
First, let me hide the layers.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,090
I don't need to make the scene uncrowded.

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,350
Isolate all the layers and shy them.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,990
And only on the character controllers.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,550
And enable the shy option.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,340
The next thing to do is delete the all white cycle animation I made with the watch cycle tool.

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,650
To do this, isolate the work cycle layer and delete it.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,250
As you can see, a warning appears for the expressions.

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,420
To delete the locks.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,200
I can completely I need to click on this magnifier and delete expressions for the properties it shows.

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,290
After deleting expressions of properties related to the work cycle tool, you'll see that the yellow

16
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,960
warning goes away and you can know that all the settings for the work cycle tool are deleted.

17
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,550
If I move the indicator in the timeline, you see nothing happens.

18
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:13,990
Before I start animating the point, you should know which you got familiar with in the animation principles

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,660
lesson.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,350
I have two methods for animating.

21
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,790
The first method is straight ahead or frame by frame.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,420
In this method, character pose is designed frame by frame, and animation is formed little by little.

23
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,800
But in the second method, which is supposed to pose, firstly, the key poses of the character are

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
created.

25
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,600
Then in between imposes and finally the animation is formed.

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,350
And because after fixed automatically creates movements between two key frames, it's better to use

27
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,800
the second method post to post the create post to pause animation, I need references.

28
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,180
So I have downloaded a reference and as you see different poses of walking or drawn here.

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,620
And the frame number related to each pose is specified.

30
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,790
Okay, I bring this.

31
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,260
Bring it higher than the background so I can see.

32
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,770
And place it here.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,980
As it's shown here, the work cycle happens in 25 frames and as you see, the frame rate is also on

34
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,360
25 frames.

35
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,550
So one second is 25 frames.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,340
So I term the work area here and start creating different poses for walking.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,670
The first pose I have here is contact.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,210
So I create a marker here and name it contact.

39
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,900
The next contact pose is on frame 13, so I go on and create another marker.

40
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,940
And also another one in frame 25.

41
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,360
Now I go for creating the first contact post.

42
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,810
As you see in the first contact, links are completely apart from each other and the character's body

43
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,590
gets lower than the straight from the characters standing because the legs are separated and obviously

44
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,880
body gets lower.

45
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,830
To do that, I open the position and rotation of the body and legs.

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Create keyframes for them.

47
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,470
I don't need other layers for now.

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,280
So I shy.

49
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,850
And also I don't need hands to.

50
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,860
So I shake the hand layers.

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,600
And to make both legs recognizable from each other, I add a little effect to the back leg.

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,240
And darken it.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
I enable the shy option and start creating the first post.

54
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,080
I bring down the character's body to bend the legs almost in this position, right leg forward.

55
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,590
And look behind.

56
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,830
As you see, when I drag the leg, too much joints get separated.

57
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,470
To prevent this, I go to a fixed control panel of this controller and in the IK section and in this

58
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,250
stretch I disable all those stretch.

59
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,400
I do the same for this controller.

60
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,640
This flick comes for an illegal and this one illegal forward.

61
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,270
I bring body a little lower.

62
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,770
I speak for the ground with a ruler.

63
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,440
And also set the ruler on the character's head.

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,090
So like the reference, I know where the character's head is supposed to be.

65
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,930
The frontal claws need to be upward, as I see in the reference.

66
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,940
So I said it's rotation on -20, and the body, as it's shown in the reference, is bends a little forward.

67
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,440
So I say on five.

68
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,080
Now let's go for creating the last contact.

69
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,260
The last contact must be exactly like the first one, as it's shown in the reference, because I want

70
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,090
to create a working cycle.

71
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,420
The beginning and end of the animation must be the same.

72
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,860
To do that, I have to copy and paste these keyframes here.

73
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,240
I select them all.

74
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,640
Go to the basil and in the animation panel I copy and paste them here.

75
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,350
Well, I go for the second contact post.

76
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,050
In this post, the legs need to be exactly opposite of the first contact, so I bring the front leg

77
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,660
to the back and set its rotation to zero.

78
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,710
And bring the back leg to the front and set its rotation to -20.

79
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,520
And create these keyframes here again.

80
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:56,830
After creating contact poses, I go for the inbetween poses, the in-between poses of two contacts or

81
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,020
passing poses.

82
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,040
So I go to frame seven.

83
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,480
Create a marker and write pass.

84
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,750
The next passing pose is on 19.

85
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,150
So I create another marker here.

86
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,100
In the first passing.

87
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,640
As you see, the leg is under the body a little behind.

88
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,810
So I said the rotation of the right leg to zero.

89
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:32,070
Bring it back and bring the body higher so the leg straightens completely.

90
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,470
The other leg has an approximate angle of 100 degrees like this.

91
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,310
And food rotation should be like this.

92
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,690
I go to the next person.

93
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,710
And the left leg needs to be straight.

94
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,200
So I said, it's rotation on zero.

95
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,170
Bring it back.

96
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,460
The A right leg should be placed like this.

97
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,050
And I placed body frames here.

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,490
I bring the leg more to the back.

99
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,230
Until now, the character walking is almost complete.

100
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,550
You have to pay attention when you create poses.

101
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,430
The movement path of the controller should be something like this.

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,380
Rotation of the body in passing poses needs to reduce.

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,610
So here I said it on three.

104
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,210
And here I set it on three.

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,700
Let's see how it looks.

106
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,930
After creating these poses, I create up and down poses.

107
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,700
The downpours is between the contact and the passing poses and the pose is between passing and contact

108
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,380
poses.

109
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,580
So I go to Frames four and 16 and create a down poses marker.

110
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,860
On frame ten and 22 is the poses.

111
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,370
Here.

112
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,960
The body comes down.

113
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Set rotation of the front leg is to zero.

114
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,440
And in the outpost, the body comes higher.

115
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,530
As you see, the body is almost upon the toes.

116
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,070
I bring it a bit higher.

117
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,460
I also paste the keyframe here.

118
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,510
Also for the second down.

119
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,870
I copy the first down keyframe.

120
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,370
And zero the rotation of this slate.

121
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,040
Let's have a look and see how it is.

122
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,420
Legs moving is almost complete.

123
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,280
Let's go to animate the head.

124
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,650
I open the head controller.

125
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,870
Create a keyframe for its rotation, and when it reaches passing, the head goes upward a little.

126
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,570
I saved on minus five.

127
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,420
In the contact poses, I say on three.

128
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
And in second person on five.

129
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,930
And ease them.

130
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,850
And if I want to make the animation continuous until second segment so I can add background and other

131
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,720
stuff, I look at the properties, I create the keyframes for them.

132
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,050
Well, I copy this expression and paste it for other properties.

133
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,970
To make the head animation clearly isolate key frames related to the contact poses.

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,920
Set them on seven and set the key frames related to the passing pose and minus.

135
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,170
Isolate keyframes and bring them back to have overlapped animation.

136
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,840
It's good.

137
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,110
Let's go to animate the hands.

138
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,230
I appear to handle layers.

139
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,230
Layers?

140
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,780
Because I have used the work cycles all before.

141
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,580
The hand controllers aren't on IK modes and they are on f k mode.

142
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,690
Now if I move the hand controller you'll see that the hand won't be changed because I'm on f k mode.

143
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,210
If I enable IK, you can see now I can control the hand, but it's better to use it k mode in working

144
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,000
animation.

145
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,270
So I disable like as it was before and start animating the hands.

146
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:27,190
And if game mode to animate the hand, I should go to the section and in individual control I can animate

147
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,040
the hand by these options.

148
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,770
First, I create a keyframe for these three properties.

149
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,170
I do the same for the left hand press you to see the keyframes.

150
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,510
And here, because the right leg is ahead, the left hand must be back.

151
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,980
I set it completely straight and I rotate the rest as much as possible.

152
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,240
And I do the same for the left hand.

153
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,160
Because the left leg is back.

154
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,170
The left hand must be forward.

155
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,090
I can bend this a little.

156
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,840
And I would say that this way.

157
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,500
I copy these keyframes and paste them for the last contact.

158
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:21,070
I go to the basil copy and paste, and for the middle contact I do the opposite.

159
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,920
First I in this.

160
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,550
Rotate this one back.

161
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,930
And bring it here.

162
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,310
Then I easy's these cue frames and look them.

163
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,130
I copy the expression and paste it here.

164
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,400
To make the overlap animation for the hand parts and make them more realistic.

165
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,570
I set the keyframes like this.

166
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,610
Let's see how it looks.

167
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,110
As you see, the hand movement is much better now.

168
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,300
Well, I don't need the reference anymore.

169
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,170
I hide it.

170
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,050
I appear the other layers.

171
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,530
I add the gradient rap effect to the background and adjust it like this.

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,200
I hide controllers and watch the animation to see how it looks.

173
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,860
This cloud should place behind the trees.

174
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,230
And I create a simple animation for the scale of the song.

175
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,520
And I look at.

176
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,350
And also I create an animation for the position of this cloud.

177
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,690
And change the cloud to it.

178
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,900
And I also have to edit this shadow animation.

179
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,210
Yeah, it's good in first contact and passing.

180
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,520
But here.

181
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,570
It should be here.

182
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:31,550
And its mode must be set on cycle to be in harmony with the work in animation.

183
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:40,040
Well, the work cycle animation has finished, and the next lesson I will deal with wrong cycle animation.

184
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,030
Good luck.
