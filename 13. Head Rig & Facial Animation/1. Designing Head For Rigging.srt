1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,990
In this video, I work on the head of a character and how to prepare it for the point that you need

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,400
to know is draw three steps for animating the head or character.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,000
The first step is designing the character and the head.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,260
The second one is rigging and the third one is animating.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,740
Every step is dependent on the next one, which means I do rigging according to the animation I want

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,050
to create for the character or its head.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,220
This means if the animation of the character is simple, the rigging process is also simple, or if

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:42,120
the animation is complex and contains a lot of positions and whatnot, the rigging process is as time

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,350
consuming and complicated and also for designing.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:53,190
What I mean is that based on how complex you want the rigging to be, the character design and the layers

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,210
of the character should be just as.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,320
Now let's get right into it.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,780
The first thing that I want to make is the circle, like part of the head.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,220
So I make this part using shape.

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,390
Let me disable stroke and feel so I can just see the path.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,100
When I want to only move one of the handles, I just hold out and then drag it.

17
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,240
I rename it to head.

18
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,190
And enable it, feel and recover it.

19
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,600
Well, after that, it's time for the back here.

20
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,890
I hold arms and drag it like this.

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,770
I hold out again, I click and hold again so I can make sharp angles.

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,050
Well, I wanted to make the bag here in a separate layer, but since the head layer was selected, it's

23
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,550
added to the head layer.

24
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,420
And so I can separate these two layers.

25
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,100
I duplicate this layer here.

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,800
I delete the second shape, and in this layer I delete the first one.

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,650
So the back here would be in a separate layer.

28
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,180
I change its color to the same color as the reference.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,420
Now it's time to work on the front hair.

30
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,900
Ask for that in order not for the front hair to move outside of the face area while animating.

31
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,850
I copy this shape from the head layer, then in the front hair.

32
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,930
In contents and I paste it here.

33
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,450
The next thing that I have to do is add merge pass modifier to the content.

34
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,030
I don't want the stroke in the merge pass.

35
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,810
I say it's more to intersect.

36
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,510
This means it will only show the areas that are in common with both James and the rest.

37
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,380
And I change color to the same color as the reference.

38
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,810
Let me rename this one as well.

39
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,210
Now, if you pay attention when I move the hair layer, it won't show anything outside of this area.

40
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,640
After that, the next thing that you need to know is that when I'm animating, definitely I'm changing

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,390
the face.

42
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,950
And as you can see, if I do so, the previous problem still remains.

43
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,190
To fix this problem.

44
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,950
I parent the face path in the front handle layer to the main face path.

45
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,550
So by picking a pair in this to this.

46
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,010
Now, if I change the shape of the face, that problem won't occur anymore.

47
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,400
And it works fine.

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,340
I move this point a little bit upper.

49
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:27,550
After that, you can see that there is a line right here to face this in the front her face and transform.

50
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,540
I increase the scale a little bit.

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,600
I say it's 101.

52
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,350
So the line wouldn't be there anymore.

53
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,990
Then I do these two hair strands.

54
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,930
I put both of them in the same layer.

55
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,820
Now let's work on the years.

56
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,570
I changed its color to the same color as the skin.

57
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,370
For both of the strokes.

58
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,440
I said line kept around.

59
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,230
So these parts would be around and I recolor it just like the reference.

60
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,820
For the other year.

61
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,490
I duplicate this layer and rename it.

62
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,820
And to flip it, isolate the layer slate only one point.

63
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,810
And by holding all and dragging, isolate all points and then hit control t I move it over here and

64
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,430
I flip it just like this.

65
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,760
As you can see in the reference, the ears aren't symmetrical and this here is a little bit bigger,

66
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,320
but I want both of them to be symmetrical, so I won't change that.

67
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,830
I move its anchor point right here.

68
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,470
Now I'll be working on the eyebrows.

69
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,530
In this truck.

70
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,120
I increased the size.

71
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,490
Then in the taper, let me slow the layer so I can see it better.

72
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,650
And the taper.

73
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,940
I set the stall length to 100 so it would look like this.

74
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,610
And I said it's slim cap to round cap.

75
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,260
I increased the start with just a bit, so this part of the eyebrow would look around.

76
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,370
For the other eyebrow.

77
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,020
I duplicate the layer.

78
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,320
Isolate one point and then I hit control A So all of the points would be selected.

79
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,060
Then I hit control T and I move it here.

80
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,230
Then I flip it so it would match the reference.

81
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,960
It looks good.

82
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,720
Now let's work on the nose.

83
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,280
I change its color just like the reference.

84
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,090
Then I increase its size.

85
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,610
Then I said the line cab to round cab.

86
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,010
Then I added stream pass to the content.

87
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,200
The next thing is the mouth to create the mouth.

88
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,170
First I make something like this for the mouth.

89
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,940
I disable its stroke.

90
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,530
I'll rename it to Mouse in contents.

91
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,360
This will be inside area of the mouth.

92
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,670
I rename it to base.

93
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,230
I enable it to feel and recolor it as.

94
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,910
Then I have to create things and a time for the mouth.

95
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,390
For that.

96
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,240
I create a shape like this for the teeth.

97
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:23,460
I changed its colour to white again, isolate contents and create another shape for the time.

98
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,910
For its color.

99
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,290
I want it to be the same as her cheeks, but a little bit darker.

100
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,720
After that, just like the front hair thing.

101
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,710
I have to mask these two shapes inside of the mouth shape.

102
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,840
For that.

103
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,460
I like to think I hit Control G and put it in a group.

104
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,250
I rename it Time Group.

105
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,190
I do the same for the teeth to.

106
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,210
Then I duplicate the base layer.

107
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,470
I put it in the time group.

108
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,050
I add the merge path.

109
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,640
I delayed the stroke and the film is the same color as the time, which is good.

110
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,340
And the marriage path, I say to intersect.

111
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,040
So now to show you what happened.

112
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,570
As you can see, the sign is only visible within the mouth shape.

113
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,250
I place its anchor point here.

114
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,290
I do the same for the teeth part as well.

115
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,190
I recall it once because it's for teeth.

116
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,300
And I said the merge bus mode to intersect.

117
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,890
I make the base visible.

118
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:07,690
As you can see, the teeth are only visible within the area of the mouth, and outside of it it's not

119
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,360
visible.

120
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,690
I place its anchor point here.

121
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,890
I make the base visible as well.

122
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,460
So as you can see, I'm done with the mouth of the character.

123
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:25,360
I should do the same as I did for the front hair, and that is if I want to animate the mouth shape.

124
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:31,480
As you can see, this problem will occur to face that under each shape of the base.

125
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,710
It opened their paths.

126
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,540
Ripen in the path of the shames that are integral to the main shape.

127
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,860
I do the same for this path to.

128
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,470
Now, if I move the shape, you can see that the other shapes move along.

129
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,260
After that, I draw another shape for the line of the mouth.

130
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,900
Here I select contents and I make a shape here.

131
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,650
Rename its line.

132
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,170
And I said, line kept around cap.

133
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,380
Then I make the mouth layer look like this so it will be hidden under the line of the mouth.

134
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,960
So let's go for the eyes.

135
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,530
First I made the white part of the eye.

136
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,170
I add a circle shape here?

137
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,910
I renamed them so they would be clear.

138
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,260
I select contents and by holding control, shift and dragging.

139
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,640
I make a symmetrical circle shape right here.

140
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,440
I name it Light.

141
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,390
And I make the eyelash just like how I made the eyebrows.

142
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,020
Then I put this in a group.

143
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,970
Isolate the group and make these two other lines.

144
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,640
I duplicate this shape and put it here and make it smaller.

145
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,830
I put these three names in one group.

146
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,120
I change the colour of the shapes.

147
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:20,950
Well, the next thing that I need to do is this part of the shame would be only visible within the wide

148
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,370
area of the eyes.

149
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,660
For this I should do just like what I did for the mouth.

150
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,590
First of all, I put lights and black in one group.

151
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,190
I duplicate the white part and put these two in one cup.

152
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,760
I go to the group of these two shapes, I add a merge path.

153
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,970
I don't want the stroke and I set the merge path to subtract and I put the black on top so this part

154
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,780
would be empty.

155
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,770
And the color should be changed to this.

156
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,800
And for this group, which contains the white and the black group, I add a merge path.

157
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,080
Delete it strong and I set the marriage path mode to intersect.

158
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,730
And I changed its film color like this because it's the black part of the eye.

159
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,080
Let me swallow the layer.

160
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,400
And I can move it without worrying about anything.

161
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,070
Let me make the white ship visible.

162
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,780
And just like before, I have to paint this ship to this one.

163
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,550
So when the main one moves, the other one moves alongside it.

164
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,750
To do so, I open the path of the white ship and the group I open the path of the Y to.

165
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,270
And I parent this to the main shape.

166
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,740
Now, if I move the Y chain, both of them move.

167
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,240
And there is nothing wrong.

168
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,070
Now in the black group Transform, I create a keyframe for its position.

169
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,920
So if I want to move it, I can simply hit your key and make the position visible.

170
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,970
Look, now I have to create another shape for the eye.

171
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,330
So it would function as its eyelid.

172
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,140
So I create another shape right here.

173
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:45,390
I disabled stroke and I changed from color to the same color as the skin, and I move it below the eyelash

174
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,460
group so that later on I can create a blinking animation for it.

175
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,970
I name it, to Ireland.

176
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,770
To create the other.

177
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:05,000
I first I convert these circle shapes to busier path so I can manually change the patterns.

178
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,340
After that, I duplicate this layer.

179
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,370
I rename it, I select the layer and pick up the pencil.

180
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,020
And by holding alls and dragging isolate all of the points and hit control.

181
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,850
TW And I move it here.

182
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,060
And I flip it.

183
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,270
Then I try to match it to the reference.

184
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,490
It looks good now.

185
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,980
And to fix the light ship the group.

186
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,940
I moved here.

187
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,840
Well, let's go for the last ship, which is the chicks.

188
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,250
I place its anchor point in the center.

189
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,520
I duplicated.

190
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,690
And move it here.

191
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,130
Then I rename it as well.

192
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,270
Okay, I hide the reference layer and make the layers I made visible.

193
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,380
So the head of the character seems fine, but here are a few points to know.

194
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,440
The ear should be behind the head.

195
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,750
And the eyes below the front her.

196
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,530
So I move the front and top her layer.

197
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,190
It's up.

198
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,140
The eyebrows should also be on top of the hair.
