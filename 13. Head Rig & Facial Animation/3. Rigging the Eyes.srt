1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,120
After that, I move on to reading the pupils.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,190
To do.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,140
So I go to the eyes layer.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,290
This belongs to the pupils.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,850
So I go to this group and the pupil group.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,040
There is a group named pupils.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,840
And there I open it, transform and create a keyframe for its position so that I can only move the pupil.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,420
As you see, when the pupil goes out of the zone, it's no longer shown.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,080
I have made this using a birch path and put in its mode on Intersect.

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,580
I hit the key and entered the lift I.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,760
I create the five eye poses.

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,790
Then isolate the keyframes and click on this option and just stick it in.

13
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,770
Let's name it I.

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I totally forgot about the no changes.

15
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,320
So I unbind the head turn joystick.

16
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,660
And I create a key frame for the start and end to create a different poses.

17
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,560
It can isolate all the key frames and click on Bind.
