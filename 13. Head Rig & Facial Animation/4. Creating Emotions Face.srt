00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,570
Let's go and create different emotions for the face.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,320
To do that, I need to make keyframes for the path of the mouth shape as well as the path of the eyes,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,420
eyebrows and ears.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,280
So I make some key frames for the values I want to change.

5
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,420
This would be the first emotion of the phase.

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:02:15,250
In the next frame, I just want to close the eyelids.

7
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,460
To make sure the blinking is done correctly.

8
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,780
I move the keyframes a little forward for about ten frames.

9
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,620
Let's have a look and see how it came out.

10
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,270
Looks good.

11
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,350
I got frame one and I need to make that I look like this is.

12
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,830
Well,

13
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,370
looks good.

14
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,210
These two islands are a bit different and I need to make them look alike.

15
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,750
After creating the blinking, I create some keyframes for the rest of the properties in frame one.

16
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,780
I move to the next frame and paste the initial keyframes here.

17
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,380
I want to show the character excitement here, so I added the mouth first.

18
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,400
And to create different math modes, you can use the references.

19
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,980
I have found this reference on the internet.

20
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:25,480
You can very easily find different references for different facial emotions.

21
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,290
Let's move to the next frame.

22
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,540
And now I want to show the sadness.

23
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,210
I move to the next frame and I want to show the angry.

24
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,470
I move on to the next frame and we're going to create the imagining mode for the face.

25
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,100
Let's move to the next frame and create the fear mode for the face.

26
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,490
Since I want the eyes to become a little bigger in this post and the pupils become a bit smaller, I

27
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,040
go to the shape layer and create some keyframes for the wide of the eye as well as the shapes related

28
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,090
to the pupil.

29
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,150
I copy these keyframes and paste them into the previous poses as well, so as not to face any problems.

30
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,530
I must do the same for this.

31
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,250
I too.

32
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,500
After creating the different face and motions, isolating all the keyframes related to the eyes.

33
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,770
Because I want to have separate sliders for controlling the different emotes.

34
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:16,430
After selecting the keyframes, I go to the slider section and click on this option to create a slider

35
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,690
for the different modes for the eyes.

36
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,060
I name it I.

37
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,800
After creating the sliders, you'll see that the null object is created here and in the effects control

38
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,930
panel of this null, you can control the same modes you've created for the eyes.

39
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,570
I added their names.

40
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,290
Then isolate the rest of the key frames and enter the joystick.

41
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,500
And a slider section.

42
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,690
I create other sliders.

43
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,560
This null object is related to the face sliders.
