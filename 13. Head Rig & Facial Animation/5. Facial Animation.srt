1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,180
And for animation, you just need to set the angry slider to 100 and in the eyes also set the angry

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,500
at 100 so that the angry mode is made for you.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,930
So animated and create a squash and stretch for the head.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:22,820
Isolate all the layers of the head except for the head layer and parent them all to the head layer and

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,490
place the head layer anchor point here.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,550
Then I can easily saw animating the head.

7
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,010
To be able to also control the eyebrows.

8
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,140
When the eye blinks, you need to go to the eyebrows and in the shape transform.

9
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,420
Create a keyframe for the position.

10
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,550
Do the same for this one too.

11
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,810
I move a frame ahead and take it to any pixels down.

12
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,520
I hit the key and select these two key frames and then go to the joystick.

13
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,800
And in this slider section I create a slider for the eyebrows.

14
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,290
The point you need to know is that when you set any mode to 100, the other modes must be at zero.

15
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,520
If the two modes are at 100, the face will be disfigured.

16
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,400
So I need to set the other modes on zero.

17
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,090
And.

18
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,410
You can go on and animate different emotions for the face.

19
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,390
Just note that if you want to change the sliders you've created into your sliders.

20
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,110
You just need to select one of the null objects.

21
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,400
For example, isolate the I emotional object.

22
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,740
Then I go to the joystick and in the slider click on create from the slider section.

23
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,720
I bring them here.

24
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,370
And as you see, these are the sliders with the same names I chosen before.

25
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:50,690
I go to the bullying slider here, you can delete the left part of your slider that you don't need by

26
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,100
disabling this option.

27
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,520
And you can go to the original layer of each one of these sliders and change your slider however you

28
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
like.

29
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,000
And just like what they did here, you can change your sliders however you want.

30
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,780
And finally, you get better acquainted with the tools and joystick script for what you do and become

31
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,600
able to use them professionally and also become familiar with the different methods to rig the head

32
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,470
using this script or find the ability to rig the different objects other than the head, such as cars

33
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,690
or anything else.

34
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,040
Enrolling my course by the link in the description, you can get it for half price.

35
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,000
Good luck.
