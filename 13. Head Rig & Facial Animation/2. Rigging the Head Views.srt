Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,920
For many motion designers, Hedrick and facial animation is very big problem and they don't know how

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,300
to do it and where to start it at all.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,500
But in this video I will show you the rig and animating the head is not as hard as you think.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,540
It just needs some practice.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,270
This is the result I want to achieve in the end.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,810
And this video I will talk about rigging the character's head, using the Jewish script and creating

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,490
a head turn animation.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,560
I also talk about facial animation and create an emotion for the face.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,140
Let's get to the training.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,480
The first thing I need is a head in the front view.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
As you see, I have created different layers for different parts of the head.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,330
From the beginning, this is the back hair.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,610
Then the ears.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,570
Then the head layer.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,650
The next layer is the front hair, which is within the range of the head layer.

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,960
The next layer is this part of the hair.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,180
And these are the cheeks.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,190
Eyes.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,790
There are many shapes in each layer.

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,790
A ship belongs to the eyelashes.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,810
The next step is for this part of the I that I made for the blink so that I can more easily create the

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,530
blinking.

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,970
The next layer is for the pupil, and the next one is for the wide of the eye.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,910
Then I have the next layer for the mouth in which the first step is related to this line, which represent

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,990
the mouth line.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,990
The next layer is related to the teeth.

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,410
The next layer is for the time, and the next layer belongs to the inside area of the mouth.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,020
Then I have a layer for the notes for which I have created such a path.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,150
And using the term pass, I want to create the different modes for it.

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,840
The last two layers are for the eyebrows.

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,780
So the first thing I should do is to create five keyframes.

33
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,060
That is five pauses for the head.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,100
The first key frame would be the front post.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,200
The second keyframe would be the right view.

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,750
The next left view then up and finally the head must go down.

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,130
Let's go for creating the keyframes.

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,090
Firstly, I open the properties of the layers that I need to make changes to them and create keyframes

39
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,140
for them so that the front view is saved in the first frame.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,270
I move to the next frame and create the right view.

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,770
Given

42
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,980
the scale of the eyes and eyebrows, must be set to 90 in this post.

43
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,100
In the next frame, I must create the left view.

44
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,540
I salute the first keyframes and go to the joystick and I click on Origin to pace the front post keyframes

45
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,010
here.

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,910
Then I create the left view.

47
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,350
Then I move on to the next frame and I must create the output now.

48
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,460
In the next frame, I create the down view.

49
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,490
After that, isolate all the keyframes and go to the joystick and click on this option in the joystick

50
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,510
section.

51
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,260
I name the joystick head turn.

52
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,730
Then click on.

53
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,150
Okay.

54
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,190
And the joystick is created.

55
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,840
Now, as you can see, by moving the joystick, the head moves perfectly to and fro.

56
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,150
There are only a few problems, and that is the cheeks go out of the face area.

57
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,500
And that's not right.

58
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,720
To solve this problem, I just need to add the same effect to the chicks layers.

59
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,070
And then define the hidden layer here.

60
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,410
Problem solved.

61
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,890
I face the same effect for this layer to.

62
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,130
The next problem is that when I move to this side, this corner of the hair comes out and I have to

63
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,850
fix it.

64
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,850
To do that, I enter the joystick and select the head, turn joystick and click on and bind.

65
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,670
In the right view.

66
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:16,290
I move this part a bit further and also in the left view, I move this point further to fix the problem.

67
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,800
Again, isolate the keyframes and click on Bind.

68
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,240
As you see, the previous problem doesn't occur here anymore.

69
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,990
Let me change the look of the joystick a little.
