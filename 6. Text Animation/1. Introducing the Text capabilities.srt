00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,930
In this lesson, we want to talk about text animations.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,880
Every motion designer or animator needs to learn about text animation sooner or later, so it's better

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,790
for us to learn about it now in the beginning.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,710
Takes Animation has many usages.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,250
For example, subtitles, title animation, and also every project with text content.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,240
The customer wants it to be editable so he can change it later.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,710
So it takes animation.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,840
Importance is obvious when we could change text without this animation getting into any problem after

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,570
Effects is a powerful software for creating text animations.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,290
It has very useful tools to make the text animation process easier and more flexible for us.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,840
What you need to learn about text animation principles and how to work with these tools.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,880
So let's get started.

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,180
Click on the text tool and click on the preview panel to create your text.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,670
As soon as you click on the preview panel, you'll see a red layer in the timeline in the Layers section,

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,730
and now you can write whatever it takes you want.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,090
Okay.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,040
After creating your text, you'll see your text.

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,020
Your name is the same as the text you have written.

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,740
Panels related to text or character and paragraph.

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,890
The character panel includes several options.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,270
The first option is for changing the font of your text.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,510
The second one can change font style.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,410
With these tools, you can change the color of your text.

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,310
For example, isolate black as the color.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,680
Here you can change the field color and to enable the stroke, you can click here and select a color

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,820
for its stroke.

28
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,880
By clicking on it.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,140
You can change the color easily.

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,510
Here you can change your text size.

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,330
Let me create another line.

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,630
Sign the whole text.

33
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,200
And here you can decide the distance between two lines.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,070
With this option, you can change the spacing between letters.

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,300
Here.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,980
If your text has a stroke, you can increase or decrease the stroke size.

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,800
And here you can specify whether the stroke is on the fill or the fill on the stroke.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,070
Here, you can apply different edits to your text.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,970
The next panel is the paragraph panel where you can change the alignment of your paragraph.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,780
Here it's on a line left.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,400
You see its anchor point is on left.

42
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,390
If I put it on a line center, you see the anchor point goes to the middle of the layer.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,710
And if I click on right, it goes to the right.

44
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,030
I put it in the center for now.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,580
So its anchor point locates in the center of the layer and press control home to bring the text to the

46
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,960
middle of the preview.

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,700
Here are the options to adjust margin and takes titles.

48
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,520
Okay.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,150
Now that you got familiar with text panels and text adjustments, let's overview the properties of the

50
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,170
text layer.

51
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,560
I open the text layer in the text section we see the first option is source text.

52
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,720
With this option, you can change the contents of your text layer.

53
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:35,040
For example, I create a keyframe here and go ten frames forward and I change my text because isolated

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,910
a line center takes in the paragraph panel when I type, the text is formed from the center and it doesn't

55
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,580
go to level rise and it's very good.

56
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,960
As you see, the keyframes are created and they are toggle hold first, the initial text is shown and

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:58,560
when I get to the second keyframe, the next text is shown and it's not necessary to create multiple

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,390
layers to change the text.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,450
Since the key frames are toggle hold, you cannot change the animation speed or edit the graph.

60
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,910
The animation changes in one frame.

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,670
The next property is the path option, which allows you to align the text along the path.

62
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,990
For example, I want to create a mask, select the text layer, select one of these shapes and create

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,650
the shape.

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,610
As you see, this layer is mask.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
To change this mask to a path so that it doesn't mask the layer.

66
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,840
I just need to put this on none so it gets ineffective on the layer after that.

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,130
In the path option.

68
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,980
In the path.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,530
I can select the path.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,180
As you can see, the text layer is arranged according to the created path.

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,120
And here you can see various options.

72
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,500
The first option is reverse path, which allows you to put your text inside or outside of your path.

73
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,190
The next option makes your leather stand vertically.

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,380
The next option may still solve your Texas spread with equal distance along the path.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,140
With margin options, you can offset your text.

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,070
To learn about more option properties.

77
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,680
We should go for animating the text.
