1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,490
Well, we get to the most interesting part of text animation animating texts.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,760
Basically, the method of animating the text layer is different from what I learned in animating layers

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,790
properties like position, rotation and scale to create an animation for the text.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,720
I need to use this option.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,210
I click on this option here.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,480
The first option is for making your characters takes 3D in 3D space.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,830
If I go to the custom view, you see the layer is 3D.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,860
Okay.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,050
I go to the animate option.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,240
Disable this option and also disable this option to turn the layer into 2D.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,800
The next section is for animating properties that you had in layer transform like anchor point, position,

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
scale and rotation.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,490
Exactly the same options I have in transform of the layers I have here so that I can create all the

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,730
animations I did for the layers I do for the takes two.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:09,020
In the next section you can animate fill color, a stroke, color and stroke with.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,310
In the next section, which is for a spacing, you can animate the distance between letters or words

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,110
and other features.

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,640
For example, I want to create an animation for takes position.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,350
So I select position.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,230
As you see, when I click on the position and the animator is added to the text layer.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,580
The subset of this animate there is a range selector.

22
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,310
Using this, you can animate your text.

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,720
First, I must apply the changes that I want to see in the position of the takes.

24
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,500
For example, I want to text go from down top.

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,780
To do this, I change the y position of the text layer and bring it down after that to animate the text

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,270
I use.

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,010
Range selector options start and and offset parameters.

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,320
Let me increase this a little.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,830
As you see, when I increase this sort, the text starts to come up from the beginning to describe it

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,300
in layer animation.

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,140
A start makes the text move from the first keyframe that is down position to the second keyframe, which

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,670
is the initial position.

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,810
If I decrease the end, you see this happening from the end.

34
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,860
Offset is for moving the saw and the end together.

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,420
Let's go for creating an animation for the text.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,330
To do that, I can use a start and end, but it's better to use offsets.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,230
I create a keyframe for offsets.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,420
Go on second one and set it on 100.

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,310
If you take a look, you see the animation is created and it takes moves from down to up.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,480
The animation has been created, but its movement is linear.

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,160
To ease the keyframes, isolate them and press f nine.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,340
I go to the craft editor and decrease the speed at the end.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,290
I also increased the animation length so the easy is looks better.

44
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,260
Let's go for the advanced settings of the text.

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,010
I go to the advanced.

46
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,020
First option is units.

47
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,250
Here you can choose a unit for your text in animation.

48
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,940
By default, it's on percentage.

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,220
You can specify your animation with a number between 0 to 100, but if you want to do it more accurately

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,200
or animate the specific leaders, you just need to set this on index.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,360
And as you see the value for the sort and and offset also changes.

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
And when I get to the second keyframe, the offset is 14, which is in fact the number of the letters

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,740
used in the text.

54
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,200
I set it on percentage again.

55
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,040
The next option is based on.

56
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,280
You can decide that you want your animation to be delivered by leather, leather by leather, ignoring

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,120
spaces, or by word or line by line.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,820
I said it on word for now to see the text animation in word by word, too.

59
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,780
The next thing to know is that for each animator I can animate multiple properties.

60
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,740
I added position here to add another property I click on ADD.

61
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,790
I go to the property and add the scale and set it on zero.

62
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,390
Let's see how the animation is.

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,390
As you see, the animation has both position and scale.

64
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,050
As I said before, I want the animation to happen word by word.

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,810
In the position is right.

66
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,470
But you see that this scale animation is letter by letter.

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,820
To solve this problem, I go to more option.

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,140
In anchor point grouping, you must choose the word so that each of your words has one anchor point

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,890
you see now its anchor point is one if was on character, each letter has its own anchor point.

70
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:21,490
So I said one word to get a single anchor point, and the scale properly applies to the whole world.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,670
And you can also specify if you want your scale animation to happen from the bottom or from the center.

72
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,780
For example, here it happens from the bottom.

73
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,750
It's because the anchor point of the takes is located on the bottom.

74
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,220
Well, I go to group alignment and bring the anchor point in the center.

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Now the text scales from the center.

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,370
I go to the advanced section.

77
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,810
The next option is mode, which has the same modes as a mask.

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,970
It's on ADD by default.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,830
If I set it to subtract, you see the animation reverses before the text would appear and then animation.

80
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,730
But now first text disappears and then animation.

81
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,740
I said mode on ad again and based on on character.

82
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,220
I delete the animator scale for now.

83
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,450
Then I go for the amounts option.

84
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,860
This allows you to control the animation of your animator generally.

85
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,510
It is on 100 by default, which is the animation I have created.

86
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,880
If I say to -100, you see, it shows the opposite animation I have created.

87
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,240
If I said it on 50, for example, it moves half of what it used to.

88
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,330
And if it's down zero, it shows nothing.

89
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
I said this as it was on 100.

90
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,430
Now I go for the next option.

91
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,840
Shape as its name represents and specifies the shape of your range selector.

92
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,270
It's on the square by default, as you see on the screen.

93
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,370
Your insulator is a square and shows the letters accordingly.

94
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,360
The next option is softness.

95
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,650
You can specify the softness of your animation here.

96
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,690
For example, let me give it some space here to make it more obvious.

97
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,300
As you see, there is move up.

98
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,780
If I set the softness to zero, you see letters don't move and jump to their next position.

99
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,060
I said it on 100 again.

100
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,550
The next option is is high.

101
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,540
This option sets a slow movement at the beginning and a fast movement at the end of the letter's animation.

102
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,540
For example, I set it to 100.

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,430
I make the keyframes linear to make their animation more obvious.

104
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,020
As you see, when the leader wants to move upward, it has a low speed at the beginning and a high speed

105
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,790
at the end.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,020
And same for other words.

107
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,570
Okay.

108
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,870
I said this is your.

109
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,140
Is law is the opposite.

110
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,960
In the beginning.

111
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,440
It has a higher speed and in the end the speed decreases.

112
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,490
In one frame.

113
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:22,130
The cylinder moves from the initial position to here and in the end it speed decreases.

114
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,750
If you want a smooth beginning and ending, I can say on 50 and this one on 52.

115
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:45,460
I think you understand now that the is high ex the same as the easy is out which is the speed is low

116
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:52,540
at the beginning and at the end the speed is high and is low is the same as eases in which is the speed

117
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,960
is high at the beginning and at the end the speed decreases.

118
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,470
But the difference is that is high and is low or for adjusting the animation speed for characters.

119
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,280
But if you make the keyframes eases, you have changed the overall speed of your text animation while

120
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,940
is high and is low just to fake the leaders animation.

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,080
This is a specific tip you need to pay more attention to it.

122
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,230
I make these key easy is again.

123
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,840
The next ship is ramp up.

124
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,450
As you see, it's for creating a ramp mode for your text animation.

125
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,900
And as it's obvious on the screen, the width of this range selector shape is two times more than the

126
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,800
square shape.

127
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:43,080
So at the beginning I must set the offset on -100 so that all of the letters placed on the initial location.

128
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,180
Let me change this to zero.

129
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,790
As you see, the overall animation is easy, is what each of the letters doesn't have.

130
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,030
Easy is and is not appealing as they are before.

131
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,470
To modify this.

132
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,950
I go to the middle of the animation and increase this.

133
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:09,570
As I said before, it is high, the speed is low at the beginning and at the end the speed increases.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,060
Here, it's slow and in the end it increases.

135
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,860
Well, I said this one on 50 and this one on 52.

136
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,710
Increase its speed a little.

137
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,430
Bring it on.

138
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,540
2 seconds.

139
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,670
To get familiar with other options in shape properly.

140
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,470
Pay attention to this clip.

141
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,360
As you see, I have brought all the options here for you to completely understand how other shapes work

142
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,940
and how the takes animations would be.

143
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,910
To make the text animation more attractive, isolate the text layer and add a mask to the layer.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,960
Set the mask mode on, subtract to hide the text at the beginning.

145
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,060
As you see, the text is not visible in the beginning and appears slowly.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,570
I increase the animation speed a little.

147
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,670
The next thing you need to know is that I can create multiple animators for a single text.

148
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,020
To create the returning animation for the text.

149
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,050
All I need to do is add another animator from this menu or duplicate this animator.

150
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,370
And bring its key frame here.

151
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,200
After doing this, I go to advanced and set it smooth to subtract.

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,140
If I play now, you'll see the tapes appearing and returning again.

153
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,980
And you can apply any changes to your first animator without the second animator affected.

154
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,420
For example, I go to advance and set based on on word.
