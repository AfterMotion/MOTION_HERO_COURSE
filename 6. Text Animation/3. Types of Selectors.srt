1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,600
In this lesson, I want to talk about selectors.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,620
As I said before, we can add different properties to the animator.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,700
As you see here, we can also add different selectors to the animator.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,160
Here I can add a new range selector or a vehicle selector or an expression selector.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,730
For example, I add a selector to the animator.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,020
As you see the lenders vehicle according to the value of the position I have entered here.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,420
And when the offset moves and gets to the second keyframe, wiggling stops.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,880
I go to the range selector now in advance and set its amount to zero so that the animation of the range

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,500
selector is disabled.

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,090
For we going to affect the text.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,020
I go into it and said it's more than AD now.

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,280
The text wiggles, but now the range selector doesn't stop it and it wiggles according to the property

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,070
set.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,600
Now, if I add a new property to the animator and like a scale and say on 50, you see its scale and

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,680
position both change, the next option's minimum and maximum amount is for determining the range of

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,430
characters changes in position and scale.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,140
For example, I set these 2 to 0.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,470
If I set the maximum to 100, you see, the scale and position of the characters don't go higher than

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,630
the value that I've entered here.

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,580
If I said it -100.

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,550
The opposite of this happens.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,620
That is the scale and position don't go lower than the value that I entered, and it's always higher

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,550
than 50.

24
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,740
I set these on default.

25
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,150
So that the scale and position of the characters can go less and more than the intended value.

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,490
Based on his obvious character or.

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,050
The second is how much characters move per second.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,330
I say ten, for example.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,760
You see their movement increased.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,470
Correlation is for controlling the vibration of your vehicle.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,150
You see now we're going happens a lot.

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,620
This means their vibration is more.

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,480
If I increase this, you'll see vibration get closer to each other and make it very smooth.

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,580
Temporal and spatial phase options or to control wiggling manually.

35
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,030
For example, I said this to zero and make a keyframe frame for temporal.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
I come here and I wanted to kill this much and then stop.

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,050
I said this on two occasions.

38
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,350
The next option is the like dimension, which is for a scale.

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,820
If I enable it, you see, the characters don't get deformed and scale on the X and y axis together.

40
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,570
The random see is to randomize wiggling.

41
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,530
I delete these for now and go for the next selector, which is the expression selector as it's obvious

42
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,600
from its name.

43
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,740
This selector is to control the animation through an expression.

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,960
When I go to expression selector, there is a based on which I talked about in amount.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,940
There is an expression option You need to write or place your expression here.

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,490
I pace the bouncing expression here and said exposition on zero.

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,580
And bring it down a little bit.

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,360
As you see it takes animation has a bouncing mode.

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,100
And here you can change its values.

50
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,770
The L.A., as its name implies, is for the delay between letters.

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,210
For example, I said this on five.

52
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,350
You see, the animation of the characters is done with a delay.

53
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,070
I press control Z to set it to the previous state.

54
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,880
The next value is the frequency, which is the number of back and forth movements or bouncing.

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,500
For example, I said this on.

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,550
Let's see how it is.

57
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,300
As you see, it gives this spring animation.

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,860
At first Control Z.

59
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,150
Amplitude or overshoot is to determine the amount of movements of the characters.

60
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,250
Look, right now the taste has gone up this much.

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,040
If I set the amplitude to 200, you see it goes higher than here.

62
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,160
And the more the value, the higher it goes.

63
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,390
Look how it is.

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,690
Let me put this on 500 to make it more obvious.

65
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,340
As you see, the amount of movement has increased a lot and they go higher.

66
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,620
Let me delete this scale.

67
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,260
Well, I bring it again on 100.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,640
Decay means energy depletion.

69
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,350
The more the value gets, the energy decreases sooner and the less it gets energy decreases later.

70
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,690
Okay.

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
I said this on one.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,390
Now you see animation stopping takes longer.

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,040
If I said this on ten, you see, the animation takes less bouncing because it's energy depletion happens

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,910
faster.

75
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,870
I said none at.

76
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,760
In the next lessons, I go for creating some useful text animations.

77
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,140
Good luck.
