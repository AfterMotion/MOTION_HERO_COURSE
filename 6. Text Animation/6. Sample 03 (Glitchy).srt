Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,400
In this lesson, I want to create a glitchy animation for the text.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,230
I write my text.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,520
Here I use the character of the property.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,190
As you see, when I increase this, the letters of the text change randomly.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,080
I put it on 35.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,000
And for this randomizing to have an animation, I use the vehicle selector.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,640
I go to the regal selector and put the regal second on five to increase its speed.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,860
I go to the range selector and create a keyframe for its offset.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,500
I go on second two and put this on 100.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,970
As you see, the takes appears thereby.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,800
I add another animator with opacity property and put it on zero.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,460
And with its train selector as the previous range selector.

14
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,000
I bring the keyframes of the first line selector a little forward to improve the randomizing.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,610
Isolate keyframes and make them easy.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,230
By the scale to the animator.

17
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,990
I duplicate this animator and this character offset.

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,080
Instead, I add the scale and put its value onto 100.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,290
I increase, it's why bring it on 600.

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,600
Let's have a look.

21
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,050
To make the tax not come down.

22
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,330
I only need to go to the more options and bring its anchor point in the middle of the text.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,570
It's good.

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,060
I can play with keyframes to improve it.
