00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,600
Okay, let's go and create the second sample of our text animations.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,260
I create a text and bring it to the center of the scene.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,630
And this time I want to create an animation for it by tracking.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,920
I create a keyframe for tracking amount.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,160
Go to the second to create another keyframe.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,280
Go back on the first keyframe and increase it until here.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,200
I added Blur to the animator.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,330
Put it on 100.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,290
And create a key frame for it.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,440
In second to I put it on zero.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,510
Also, I create a scale for the ticks in the soil.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I increase its scale and in the end to 100.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,990
I decrease tracking a little and to place the anchor point at the center of the ticks.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
I go to the more options and place the anchor point in the middle.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
Isolate keyframes and make them easy.

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,400
Ease.

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,600
I go to the graph editor and make the second keyframe smoother.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,320
Let's see how it looks.

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,510
It's very good.
