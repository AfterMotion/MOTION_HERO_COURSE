Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,010
In this video, we're going to learn the bouncing text animation.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,480
Let's do it.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,450
First, create a text ahead, control home to set the text layer in the center of the comp.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,530
Then as a position animator to the text.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,820
And here, add an expression selector.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,710
And delete the range selector because we don't need it.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,980
An expression selector in a base.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,900
The bounce expression here.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,040
Set the Y position on -150.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,560
If you do it opposite, the thanks goes up.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,330
And also you can use this expression for any property you want.

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:58,250
Well, if you want to personalize the animation, you can go to the expression and change these values.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,560
Frequency determines the speed of the bounce.

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,730
For example, if I set it on 20.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,870
You can see the speed increases.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,810
Amplitude or overshoot determines the power of the bounce.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,300
For example, the ladder moves down up to here.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,010
But if I set it on 600, you'll see it goes further down.

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,470
Decay defined the amount of energy loss.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,670
The more you increase the decay, the sooner the animation stops and the less you decrease, the later

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,660
it stops.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,330
If I said this to Tim, it will stop sooner.

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,090
DeLay determines the delay of the letters animation.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,180
For example.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,560
I set it on five.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,890
To make the animation looks better.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,960
I want to add a rotation to it so I duplicate the animator, delete the position.

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,910
And the rotation.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,970
And also enabled the pre character 3D to be able to rotate the leather separately.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,970
Set it on -90.

32
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,310
Go to the expression, decrease the decay a little so that the rotation bonus stops later.

33
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,780
After that mask the text layer and set its mode on subtract.

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,010
Well, if you want to use this animation you've created as a preset in another project, select the

35
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,960
animators and in animation menu, click on Save Animation Presets and save it as a preset.

36
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,710
And then if you want to create the same animation for your text in another project, select the text

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:16,030
layer and in animation menu, select the upload animation presets and open your preset.

38
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,530
And finally, you just have to mask your layer.

39
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,840
Och, that's it.
