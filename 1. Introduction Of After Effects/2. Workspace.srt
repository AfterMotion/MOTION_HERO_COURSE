Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,400
Before I start the course, seriously, and learn how to work with keyframes and create different animations

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,870
in after effects, it's better to get acquainted with the after effects, panels, workspace and also

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,620
tools This software gives us a bit, so those who are about to learn after effects for the first time get

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,630
familiar with the software entirely and be able to follow us in the next levels.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,620
In this lesson, we want to talk about after Effects user interface and learn how to adjust our workspace

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,150
according to our needs.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,030
After I open after effects, the first window to appear is home where you can see projects you have used before.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,770
And by clicking on the new project, you can create a new project.

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,950
And with the open project button, you can open a project you have already saved.

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,740
I click on the new project and enter the work space of AfterEffects.

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,250
The first thing I have to do is to set up workspace in standard mode.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,780
I go to the Windows menu workspace section and click standard.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,300
As you see, panels changed and our work space went to standard mode.

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,390
If your work space is not like this, after clicking on a standard, you just have to go to the Windows

16
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:36,100
Workspace and select reset standard to saved layout so that the standard layout resets to its default settings.

17
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,930
Now your work is this panel should be exactly like mine.

18
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,770
But if it's not the case or by mistake, you close a panel.

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,260
You just need to go to the Windows menu.

20
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:56,130
Here you can open all of the panels again and see what panels are now open in standard mode.

21
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,820
Well, I closed the effects and presets panel and I open it again from here.

22
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,640
You can see it came back.

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,020
You can easily change panel positions and place them wherever you want in after effects, or you can

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,320
make your panel float by pressing this button.

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,480
If you wanted to change back, you can click on the panels name and drag it back here.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,940
After you adjust your panels as you want.

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:37,030
You can save this work space from Windows, Workspace, and save as a new workspace and name it whatever

28
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,750
you want.

29
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,060
For example, I name this one new.

30
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,740
As you can see here, our workspace is saved.

31
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,250
If I go to default and then select new, I go back to the workspace I made before.
