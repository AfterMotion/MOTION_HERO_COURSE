00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,510
Well, let's have a look at the menus in after Effects.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,040
The first one is the file, including options divided by these lines.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,390
The first section is for creating an opening project.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,310
You can open a project by clicking on the open project or pressing Ctrl + O.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,970
For example, I open this project.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,470
The second section is for closing projects and also saving the project you are working on.

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,230
And one of the interesting options existing here is increment and save, which allows you to save several

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,980
versions of your project without changing its name every time.

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,220
The next section is for importing and exporting files.

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,200
With these options, you can export and import different files in after effects.

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,280

You can save your project, alonge with every footage and pictures have used in it as a folder wherever you want.

13
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:14,230
This option is useful when you want to move your project to a different computer and continue your work there.

14
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:21,150
As I said, you just need to go to the file menu, dependencies, collect files and then click collect.

15
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,590
As you see here, it shows your collect folder size.

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:32,050
I click collect and I choose desktop for example, and the project will be saved in the specified location.

17
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,490

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,650
too heavy and your frames are not shown correctly.

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,250
