1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,780
Now that we have learned how to make a composition and add new layers to the composition, it is time

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,040
to learn how to import footage, images and layers that are outside of the after effects, 

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,380
for importing a file into the after effects.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,920
You just have to double click in this blank area of the project panel.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,820
Then choose your file and click import.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,500
For instance, I choose this photo and click import.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:36,950
You see, this selected photo is now added to the project panel, and by dragging it on the timeline,

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,140
you can add it to the composition.

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,720
This is for when you want to import photos into your project.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:53,200
Another way to import your file into the after effects is to click on file import and finally click on file.

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,440
Then you can bring your file into AfterEffects.

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,790
This time I import my video file into the project.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,380
And as you can see here, my video file is added and by dragging it into the comp, we can work on it.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,080
The next thing to know is that sometimes you need to add an illustrator file that contains several layers itself.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,200
When you import these kinds of files into aftereffects, a window like this will appear.

16
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,630
Here you can adjust different settings.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,620
In the first section, you decide whether you want to import this file as a composition or footage.

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,820
If I choose footage, the down section activates for me.

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,510
By this option you can import all the layers as one layer, and by this one you can import each layer separately

20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,020
 so only that layer gets imported.

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:56,430
I choose composition here and in footage dimensions you have two options Layer size and document size.

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:04,120
Document size means that each layer will import as big as your composition, but layer size means that

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,530
each layer will import as big as the object in a particular layer.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,240
For example, I choose layer size and click okay, as you see composition with the name of the original

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:24,430
file that we selected is created and also a folder is created in which there are illustrator file layers.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,280
Well, I double click and open the new comp.

27
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,460
As you see, it has different layers and each one of these layers has its own area.

28
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,710
See, this layer area Is this much 

29
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,130
the eye area Is this much

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,970
It is because I selected the layer size option before.

31
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,080
How would it be if we had selected document size?

32
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,940
I do it one more time.

33
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,710
As you see now, the size of this layer, which is for the head, is as big as my comp size 

34
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,230
or this layer for here it's the same.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,910
All of these layers have the same size as the comp size.

36
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,790
This will be problematic for you when you want to select each layer with the selection tool.
