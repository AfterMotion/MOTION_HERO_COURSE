1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,960
The next thing we need to know is the panel.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,500
And in this lesson, I want to talk about the most important panels.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,660
Well, the first and important panel we have in After Effects is the project panel.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,840
Layers, films, pictures, compositions, folders, and everything we have used in our project are place in this panel.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,620
By selecting any of these items, you can see a little preview of the item here and you can acquire

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,990
some details about this item, which is a composition as you see its Size is shown.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,980
And here comp duration.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,460
And here frame rate is visible, at the bottom or some options.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,240
With this, you can create a folder and organize items in the project panel.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,810
The next option is create a new composition.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,570
By this, you can create a new composition.

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:59,300
And the next option brings up the project setting window where you can change your project settings.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,530
And the next option is for deleting selected items.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,950
The next panel is composition or viewport.

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,030
As you can see in front of the name of this panel is written 'space'.

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:19,330
And this means I have opened the com namespace from the project panel and also in the timeline, the

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,370
composition or space is shown.

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,570
And as you see, the composition panel shows all the items that are in the comp space.

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,760
And using this panel, you can see whatever happens in your comp, in the bottom part of the viewport

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,320
or composition panel.

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,320
There are tools that I will mention, important ones.

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,280
This tool is for zooming in and zooming out of the viewport.

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,330
The next tool is for activating or activating rules and guidelines.

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,490
The next tool activates or activates paths for shapes and masks.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,170
Here you can specify a time so the indicator shows in the timeline.

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,350
This one is for taking pictures, by clicking on it

27
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,520
You can take a shot and if you make changes by holding down this button, you can see the changes you

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,300
have made.

29
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,690
The next option resolution, which is very important, is for when you have a heavy project, you can

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,650
reduce viewport resolutions, so your project works slightly.

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,600
This option is for when you want to render a specific part of the composition.

32
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:35,540
The next option is transparent, which shows the areas that are transparent or with no pixels.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,550
In this project, I don't have transparency.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,900
If I hide the background, you see, it shows the areas that are transparent.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,870
The next option is for perspective.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,020
By this you can have different perspectives of your layers and it is more practical when you put your

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,400
layers in 3D mode.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,390
This option is for when you want different views of your project.

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,980
As you see, you can control your view in double, triple, quadrupole and other different kinds of view.

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,130
Another important panel to be discussed is the timeline panel.

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,290
As you see, this panel has two main sections.

42
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,890
One of them is for timeline and time progress, and the left section is for layers and their settings.

43
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,830
By clicking on this arrowhead, you can see settings for the layers here.

44
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,470
here You can control visibility of the layer.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,230
If it's a sound layer, here you can mute and unmute it.

46
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,110
With this, you can solo a layer.

47
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,890
With this one, you can lock it so it cannot be selected.

48
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,960
In this section you have time line.

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,380
By dragging this, you can specify your work area.

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,560
Or you can use the B key for the setting of the beginning and N for the ending of the work area.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,420
By holding alls and scrolling, you can make the timeline bigger or smaller.

52
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,080
Also you can use this option for the same, making it big or small.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,750
Or click on these icons.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,790
Now that we got familiar with the main panels in After Effects, let's have a look at the layer settings

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,140
and options existing in the transform of the layer 

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,450
in transform, The first option is the anchor point.

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,920
By this, you can move the layer anchor point to any place you want.

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
The second value is position.

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,440
By this one, you can adjust the position of your layer.

60
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,350
Or you can just change it by dragging the object.

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,990
As you can see, changes in position or applied here.

62
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,970
The next option is the scale.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,880
You can make your layer bigger or smaller.

64
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,220
And also, if you take down this chain, you can change size in one direction.

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,900
The next option is rotation.

66
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,080
Using this option, you can rotate your layer.

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,510
Also, there is an opacity option by which you can change the transparency of the layer.

68
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,600
If you want to just work on the position of a layer and you don't need the other values, 

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,990
you just have to select the layer and press p on your keyboard.

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,840
So only the position value appears.

71
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:36,090
Or if you only want the anchor point, you can press A; for scale press S; for rotation R.

72
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,020
And T for opacity.

73
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:47,270
And if you want to values, you just have to hold down shift after appearing opacity and press p for the position.

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,740
Now, if you want to add a scale too you can keep holding down, shift and press S.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,060
And if you want to make one of these values disappear, you can do this by holding down shift and pressing

76
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,380
the related hotkey.

77
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,470
For example, I hold down, shift and press T.

78
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,220
You can see opacity is disappeared.

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,210
So A is for opening the anchor point; P for the position.

80
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:21,630
S for scale, R for rotation and T for the opacity of layers and also for adjusting the ending and

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:28,530
beginning of your layers in the timeline, you can use close bracket and open brackets, open bracket

82
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,450
for specifying the beginning of a layer and close bracket for specifying the ending of a layer.

83
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:42,180
And also you can use Alt + [ for trimming the beginning of the layer and Alt + ] for the ending.

84
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,810
And as I said before, B and N are use for specifying the beginning and end of the work area.

85
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,010
And for changing the layer's name first select the layer.

86
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,980
Then press enter and write the name you want.
