1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,890
One of the main panels in the after effects is the Tools panel or toolbar.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,570
The first tool is home.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:14,400
By clicking on it, you can open the same window as the one that opens at the beginning when after effects run.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,490
The next tool is selection.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,050
But this one, you can select objects in your scene and move around.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,520
It's hot key as it's written Here is V.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,210
The next one is hand.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,460
This will allows you to move the viewport and the scene itself.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,890
The next tool is Zoom, 

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,610
using this tool you can zoom in and out by holding Alt and clicking.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,860
You can zoom out.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,110
And without Alt, Zoom in.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,940
I press V

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,560
So we get back to the selection tool and for using the hand tool temporarily.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,080
All I have to do is to hold down space and adjust your viewport by hand tool.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,940
And as soon as you release it, the selection tool will be activated again.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,280
I go to the next group of tools.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,490
The first tool is rotation.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,580
Using this tool, you can rotate your layers.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,910
The next tool is the camera.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,990
This one activates when you have a camera in the scene for adding a camera layer to composition.

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,900
I Right click here and from new I add a camera to the comp

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,500
After that, you see that the camera tool is activated for us and you can see the capabilities of this

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
tool and it's hotkey is C.

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,590
The next tool is pen Behind.

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,260
this tool allows you to move and put the anchor point of your layer anywhere.

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,910
So all the changes to the layer happen according to the anchor point.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,500
If I select the rotation tool and start rotating, you see now it rotates around the new position of

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,520
the anchor point.

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,810
Also, if I use the selection tool and change layer size, it happens from the anchor point.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,470
Now we go to the next group.

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,860
The first is the rectangle tool.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,030
By holding down the left click.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,150
We can see other tools too.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,430
Let me create a rectangle here.

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,290
As you see, when I create a rectangle here, a new layer is added to the timeline, and here you can

37
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,610
see settings related to this layer.

38
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,770
When I choose the last layer, you see these options appear.

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,630
And when I choose this one, you see other options appear for adjusting this layer.

40
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,450
Well, I delete this layer.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,370
The next one is the pen.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,390
Using the pen tool, you can create every shape you want.

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,370
The next tool is T, which is used to create text layers.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:01,150
The next group of tools, including Brush, Stump and Eraser, has a unique property, which is you cannot

45
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,330
make changes to the layer in the composition panel and you have to open them in the layers panel to

46
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,830
be able to edit them.

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:16,420
For this, I double click on the layer, so the layer opens up in the layer panel and now you can use

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,270
the brush tool and make the changes you want.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,910
And from here, you can adjust the Bruch setting like color.

50
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,720
Let me select the eraser tool

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,680
And to make it bigger, I press Ctrl + Left click and drag.

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,220
For example, I want to erase this part.

53
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,660
Let me put it in transparency mode so it is completely clear.

54
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,180
As you see, we only can use this tool in the layer panel.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,930
After we make the changes we want to the layer.

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,020
We go back to the composition panel and here we see that changes also will be shown here.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,480
The next tool is the Roto brush.

58
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,190
This one is mostly used for rotoscoping and background removal.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,060
The next one is the puppet pin, which has several usages and is mostly used to rig characters.

60
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,660
It's also good to introduce the effects control panel.

61
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,130
Here, this panel shows the effects that are applied to the layers.

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,330
For example, if I add a gradient effects to this layer, you see here in effect control of the layer 'mars1'

63
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,770
the settings of the effects and you can control them.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,360
Okay.

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,790
I delete this now.

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,120
I go back to the sun layer now.

67
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,040
And as you see, we have changed the layer using paint tool.

68
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,370
So now there is a paint effect in the effects control panel.

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,930
And by deleting this effect, our layer goes back to its original state.
