00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,200
Well, in this lesson, we want to learn how to create a new project in After Effects.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,570
As you know, when we open aftereffects, the home window will appear for us.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,030
Here you can create a new project.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,020
And here you can open the project you have saved before.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,350
And here are the projects you have used recently.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,750
I click on the new project, and new project is created for me.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,800
You can also do this using the file menu, new and new project.

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,130
After we've created a new project and after things here you can see your project name.

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,700
But before you save your project and choose a name for it, it is named Untitled Project.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,500
And after you save your project and choose a name, here you can see your project address and its new name.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,560
After creating your project, the first thing we need to do is to create a new composition.

12
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:08,030
Composition is like an artboard in Photoshop, which allows you to choose your clip size, duration,

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,730
frame rate and other settings.

14
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:17,360
In order to create a new composition, I click on the new composition, and then the composition setting

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,160
window is shown to me.

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,880
You can do the same from the project panel and by clicking on Create new composition button.

17
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,920
The other way to do this is by clicking the new composition from the composition menu or using Ctrl + N

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,740
to create a new comp.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,610
After that, the composition settings window will appear.

20
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,080
here You can choose a name for your composition here.

21
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,470
here there are some presets to make adjustments easier to create a comp.

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,150
For example, it is now on HDTV ,1080, and 25 frames.

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,450
You see I select

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,650
This preset our resolution is set to 1920 By 1080,

25
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,880
 the pixel aspect ratio is set to squre pixel and the frame rate is 25.

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,210
But if I select this preset you see our resolution changes, frame rate changes and all the other

27
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,650
settings changed to.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
I put it on the last one here.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
here You can set the width and height of the camp.

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,710
Here is your comp frame rate,

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,320
Here, you can specify your comp duration.

32
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,670
For example, it starts from 0 to 20 seconds.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,470
And here you can make a decision about your composition background.

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,380
I choose gray for it and click okay.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,490
After I click okay, you can see that new composition is created with the name I specified.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,030
And here the comp duration is on 20 seconds as I decided in composition settings.

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:03,830
After I create a composition, I can add different layers to the timeline, to add new layers to the composition.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,040
I just have to open the comp.

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,280
Right click on the timeline and in the new section I can add different kinds of layers.

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,580
For example, I add a text to the comp.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,290
You see, a text layer is made and you can type whatever here.

42
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, note that adding a layer is only possible when you already have a composition.

43
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,430
If I delete this composition and try to create a new layer, you can see that by right clicking no option

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,860
is going to appear.

45
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,900
it is because there is no comp in the timeline.

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,450
So first we need to create a comp and then start to add new layers to it.

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,540
Okay, Now I add a solid to the time line when I choose solid.

48
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,870
Here you can choose your settings for your solid.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,370
Change its name.

50
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,570
Change its color.

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,050
And here make a decision about its size.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,300
I choose a size a smaller than my comp size and click okay.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,210
You see, a solid is created for us.
