00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,120
Hi, and welcome to the motion hero course

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,830
In this course, you will become a better version of yourself in motion graphics.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,310
So I want you to be patient and follow me to the end of this course and come along with me step by step

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,630
during tutorials and practices to get the intended results.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,740
This course for people who are familiar with after Effects, but for those who are still beginners and don't

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,010
know too much about after effects, don't worry, because I've set this course the way that even beginners

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,380
can also follow it.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,510
So in the beginning we will get to know about after Effects, but I'm not going to introduce all the

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,060
after effects tools and confuse all of you.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,020
In the beginning.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,320
You'll just learn the required tools in motion graphics and animation, but the other more advanced

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,500
tools in future lessons during practices.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,340
So let's see what we're going to learn in this course.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,320
In the beginning, you will learn about the main and important panels of after effects.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,060
After that, the tools, then the features of the composition and how to create it, and also its settings.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,880
And finally, you will learn how to import your files into after Effects.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,710
Then we'll talk about concepts and tools we need to create animation.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,540
At first you will learn what actually a keyframe is and how to create it.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,940
Then you will learn all different types of keyframe and when to use each type.

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:38,480
Then you get acquainted with graphs and how to use them to lead and master your animations and control everything.

21
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,980
In the following you will learn about keyframes interpolation, all types of them, and how they work.

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,380
And also you will learn where to use each type.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:58,610
After you learn all about animation tools, we're going to do a little simple practice to put what we've learned into an actual project.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,330
Then to better understand the timing, spacing and easing that are some of the most important principles of animation.

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,130
We'll do a couple of Bouncing ball exercises.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,490
Firstly, we'll start with a simple exercise and create a beautiful bouncing ball animation.

27
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,860
In the next practice that is a little more advanced.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,180
You will learn how to make a bouncing animation using a reference, since working with references is

29
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,090
one of the most important things in animation.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,140
It's better for you to learn how to use them early in the course and for the last practice with help

31
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,810
of creativity and what we've learned, we're going to make a complex, bouncing ball animation.

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,680
And then you will learn about some other important principles of animation and how to use them in your works.

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,760
in this step.

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,170
You will learn how to use anticipation in your animations and also how to make your animations more

35
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,210
alive and interactive with overlapping and follow through principles.

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,610
Be aware that these practices and principles are very important, but most motion designers ignore them

37
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,860
and it makes them not have a good understanding of movement and animation.

38
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,460
And finally, they cannot create attractive animation.

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,460
In the next chapter, you'll learn about the 12 principles of animations and how to use them in motion graphics clips.

40
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,350
After that, you will get familiar with text layers and their performance and also all types of selectors.

41
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,470
And to have a deep understanding of the content, we will create three takes animations together.

42
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,410
We talked about animations and we better also mention Lettering animation.

43
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,590
So in this chapter, firstly, you will learn how to make your write in effect for the letters, 

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,250
how to make them more attractive by adding bouncy animation.

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:05,630
Then you'll learn how to add details to your animation to increase its beauty and in the end to completely

46
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,130
learn all steps to create a lettering animation.

47
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,840
We will animate a text from top to bottom.

48
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:20,060
After that, you will learn about logo animations, how to create them and the tools we need for logo animation

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:26,480
Also, you will learn how to make your logo animations make sense and give debth to them.

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Another technique that every motion designer should know is creating loop animations.

51
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,500
In this chapter you will learn what principles you should follow to create a standard loop animation.

52
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,390
And then we put these principles into use to make a good loop animation

53
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:52,690
After that, you get familiar with one of the most beautiful techniques of motion graphics called Morph animation.

54
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,080
In the beginning you will learn what things you need to create a smooth morph animation and then will

55
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,480
start to morph three different objects to make you guys ready for serious projects.

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:13,720
And finally, with anticipation, bouncy animation and adding details to our animation will make it as attractive as possible.

57
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,220
In the next chapter, we're going to talk about character rigging 

58
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,970
And since we do this with Duik Bassel script, first, you will learn how to install it.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,090
Then we will have a little introduction to it and you will learn the required tools for rigging.

60
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,560
And after you are entirely introduced to the script, I will start from the most basic concepts of rigging, meaning preparing the character,

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,510
 and then you will learn how to skeletonize the character.

62
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,500
Then you'll learn to create an automatic work cycle animation without any keyframe.

63
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,700
In the next chapter, you will learn how to animate characters in this chapter.

64
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,760
You will learn how to use references.

65
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,250
And also you get familiar with different walking poses.

66
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,980
And finally, you can create a beautiful walking animation on your own.

67
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,600
After that, you will learn how to create a walking cycle without references and using only three principles.

68
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:24,420
And also you will learn how to create running cycles with the help of references and also without any references.

69
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,500
And in the last chapter, you will learn how to rig a head with the joysticks and sliders and create

70
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,390
different facial emotion for it so that you can create a cool animation for the character's head.

71
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:46,250
The important point to know is that this course will be useful for you if you always keep your aftereffects open 

72
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:54,650
and do exactly what I do step by step and don't just watch clips because motion graphics is a skill,

73
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,730
not a knowledge.

74
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,100
So you need a lot of practice.

75
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,830
And if you have any problems or any questions during this course, you can join our Facebook group and

76
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:14,890
share your questions and experiences with other students of this course and get your answers from me right away.

77
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,080
And the last thing, if you like to continue this way and don't want to be stopped midway, 

78
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,880
you can join my YouTube channel and watch more updated advance tutorials.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,230
I will try to upload tutorials once a week there, so let's go to the next lesson and start our learning.
