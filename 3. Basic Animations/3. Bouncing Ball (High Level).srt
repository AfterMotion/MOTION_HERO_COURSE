00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,610
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,050
In this lesson, I want to create another bouncing ball animation.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:13,110
In this exercise, I have made things more difficult to gain better control over the spacing, timing,

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,040
squishing and stretching of the animation.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,600
This is the reference I want to use it.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,620
And as you see, I have created these lines that the ball is supposed to make contact and move on them.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,520
The ball is going to get squashed and throw itself toward this direction.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,500
And after within this lever it jumps and goes this way, moves and hits under this line, then lands

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,550
on this lever.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,620
This lever goes down a little and then throws the ball up and it comes here and jumps a few times and

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,910
at the end goes up a little and comes back.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,560
The difference between this and previous practice is that here we don't use references because you want

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,520
to do the spacing and timing of the animation ourselves.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,560
So if in the future we want to create an animation, we get to do this with our own ideas and timings.

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,610
But note that this practice doesn't mean that not using references is better.

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,900
So to reach our goal better and easier, it is good to use references, but my intention for this practice

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,610
is to improve your ability and creativity to make it fantasy animation because you can always find references

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,980
for the idea you have in your mind.

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,970
And in these times only your creativity will help you.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,120
Well, let's get started.

21
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,610
First, I rotate this almost at this angle.

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,890
The ball is going to hit this lower.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,660
I hide extra layers to have only the ball layer in the timeline.

24
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,070
I open the position of the ball.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:57,130
The next point I have to say is that this time I didn't create this fall with the sphere effect because

26
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,320
sometimes our layers are shapes.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,620
This time I find it better to work with shapes so we learn how to create a squash and stretch and rotation

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,330
for the ball using shapes.

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,540
Well, first we need to create the main key frames to know where the ball is going to be in different

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,770
situations.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,930
After that, we need to adjust the path and then work with graphs and the speed of the animation.

32
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,650
Then we're going to create a squash and a stretch, and at last we will work with ball rotation.

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,660
So first I need to create the main keyframes or key poses.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,730
To begin, I go to frames forward because I want to create a squash for the ball, so it requires energy

35
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,630
for the jump.

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,650
I create a keyframe here for the position.

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Go three frames forward.

38
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,530
The ball needs to hear approximately.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,150
Again.

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,130
I go through frames forward.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,140
The ball comes here.

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,060
Throughout this Q frame here.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,550
The next movement is that when the ball hits, the sliver goes here and moves the line.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,520
This slide.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,230
So I go seven frames forward and place the ball here.

46
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,630
Go six frames forward and bring the ball here.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,450
After four frames, the ball should locate here three frames forward.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,760
It comes here with wants to jump again, three frames forward.

49
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,340
It comes here.

50
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,510
For now, I'm creating the keyframes and their timing by guess.

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,630
But when the animation path and timing get decided, the key frames and both locations may change.

52
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,560
I go for frames for and it moves here.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,240
In two frames, it goes lower.

54
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,110
In six frames.

55
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,210
It jumps and locates here.

56
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,590
After five frames, I place it here.

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,030
It should be here after four frames.

58
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,030
After three frames, it must be here.

59
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,990
And after five frames it should be here.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,240
Then after five frames, the ball is on the ground.

61
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,610
Again.

62
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,170
The ball comes up.

63
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,910
And go down again.

64
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,730
It comes up.

65
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,800
Comes down.

66
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,660
After five frames, it goes here.

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
And after ten frames, it goes back here.

68
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,560
For now, I have created the main keyframes for the animation.

69
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,700
Now it's time to create the path for the ball.

70
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,470
I right click on this keyframe, go to the spatial interpolation and set it on continuous base year

71
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,290
so that both handles change together.

72
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,010
It hits.

73
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,840
And then I said this one on continuous busier.

74
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,950
Isolate these key frames and set them on continuous busier.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,530
Let's have a look.

76
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,540
The path needs to be edited here.

77
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,880
This key frame needs to be on busier.

78
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,660
It should be only a little over.

79
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,670
This needs to move like this.

80
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,890
And I continue like this to edit the whole path.

81
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,910
Well, let's see how the ball passes.

82
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Look, path is good for now.

83
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,340
Let's go for editing the speed of the animation and easing in the keyframes.

84
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,990
Isolate these keyframes when the ball is floating.

85
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,760
Gravity effects it and decreases its speed.

86
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,260
And I make them easy.

87
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,720
Let's see how it is.

88
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,500
It's better now, but this key frame is needed to be on easy as well.

89
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,770
And also this keyframe.

90
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,440
Isolate this keyframe and go to the graph editor and increase its influence or easing.

91
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,360
I double click on it and make it continuous and set its speed to 50.

92
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,420
So I don't get a pause here.

93
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,200
It needs more speed to have no puns here.

94
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,480
Here.

95
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,920
I need to increase easing or influence and make it continuous busier and set its speed to 100.

96
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,870
There is a pass.

97
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,490
I need to bring this one a little higher.

98
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,150
It's too much.

99
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,980
It should be a little over.

100
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,940
I think it should be here.

101
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,310
I go forward.

102
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,220
Here.

103
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
There is no need to pause until it comes here.

104
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,560
So isolate these three key frames and make them roll across.

105
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,570
It comes down, rotates.

106
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,090
It's this and comes here.

107
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,560
Delays along here.

108
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,420
So I decrease the distance between keyframes.

109
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,850
It comes down and jumps fast.

110
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,390
I go to the graph editor and also here the speed needs to be reduced.

111
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,800
And the keyframes between this jump and the next jump need to be rolled across so that the speed doesn't

112
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,600
have any pause here.

113
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,120
The speed must be reduced here again.

114
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,350
The same for this one as well.

115
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,140
And to eliminate the pass.

116
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,670
I bring this higher.

117
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,030
I bring it a little bit higher to.

118
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,810
And this one to.

119
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,680
Let's see how this part looks.

120
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,290
Okay, it's good.

121
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:41,590
But here, when the ball finishes the final jump, it's not well adjusted, so I delete them and create

122
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,640
the path again.

123
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,970
In ten frames.

124
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,320
It goes here.

125
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,500
And in the next ten frames, it comes back.

126
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,770
I said this keyframe on Busier.

127
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,140
Let's see how this.

128
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,630
I go to the graph editor and increase its speed here.

129
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's have another look.

130
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,360
I bring these only little here.

131
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,470
Make this across time.

132
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,100
And this one is the is.

133
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,560
Let's take a look at the whole animation.

134
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,890
Okay, it's good.

135
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,790
Now I go to add in squash and stretch.

136
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:17,620
To do this, I open the scale and rotation of the layer, create a keyframe here for them to be able

137
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,280
to know this.

138
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,750
The rotation of the layer.

139
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,090
Will I add a red line to the ball?

140
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:29,110
So I get to follow its rotation, better isolate these keyframes and move them five frames forward to

141
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,500
create a squash in effect for the ball so that it can acquire energy for the jump.

142
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:43,050
I go three frames forward, set the X on 18 and decrease the same amount I increased there and say on

143
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,460
12 and put it lower.

144
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,530
I think 19 and 11 is better.

145
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,770
First, the ball needs to be in its original form, so I copy this keyframes to the beginning.

146
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,290
Let me first adjust the rotation of the layer.

147
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,470
Then I go to a squashing and stretching.

148
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,510
All I need to do is to adjust the rotation according to its path.

149
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,290
I have fixed the rotation.

150
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,580
Let's have a look to see how it is.

151
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,790
Okay, It's good.

152
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,620
Now I got to create a squash and stretch.

153
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,080
Isolate these key frames, make them easy.

154
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,340
I just make these keyframes linear to increase the jumping speed.

155
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,950
Here it is.

156
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,890
Squashes.

157
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,110
Here it should stretch.

158
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,540
I said this on 14.

159
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,290
And that one?

160
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,090
16.

161
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,550
Here, it returns to its original form.

162
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Here again, I paste this keyframe.

163
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,840
Here in the why should be on 12 and this on 18.

164
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,880
Anything is too much.

165
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,170
Make it 17.

166
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
And this on 30.

167
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,340
In the next frame because the lever hits the ball straight should be more than the previous jump.

168
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,100
It returns to its original form.

169
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,280
Here, I paste this key frame again.

170
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,370
Here.

171
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,900
It should stretch again.

172
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,620
It is gorgeous here.

173
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,040
So I paste the scale keyframe of this position here.

174
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,630
And put it up a little.

175
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,370
Here it should assuage to.

176
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,500
Its rotation must be toward this.

177
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,870
Here in the squashes.

178
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,850
One frame later it stretches.

179
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,340
Generally when the ball is in the air, it keeps its original form.

180
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,580
And when it's falling or rising it stretches.

181
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,550
And when it hit something it is cautious.

182
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,130
So I continue to work and according to the ball speed, I just squash and stretch.

183
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,870
And here it rotates and goes ahead.

184
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,330
Let's have a look and see how it is.

185
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,900
Okay, I'll go here and animate this lever to.

186
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,390
I put in the layers, isolate this layer, and inside them I create a keyframe here for its rotation.

187
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:12,240
In the next frame, I bring it down and after two frames, I bring it here.

188
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,440
And little higher.

189
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,610
It's good.

190
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,480
Easy is this and create a spring animation for it.

191
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,090
Let's see how it looks.

192
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,460
The speed from here to here is.

193
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,740
So I increase it here.

194
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,580
Here.

195
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,480
When the ball hits the bottom of this layer, it must be squashed.

196
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,190
So I move the next keyframes forward to give it a chance to be squashed.

197
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,280
I have to slow down this keyframe speed.

198
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,590
So I go to the graph editor.

199
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,950
Double click on it and put 100 for a speed.

200
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,260
There should then be a person here for this.

201
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,360
So I make this key frame across time.

202
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,550
And correct it's rotation.

203
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,120
I bring this keyframe forward a little.

204
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,530
So it is Stretch happens later.

205
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,090
Well, it's good to animate this sliver, too.

206
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,980
I enjoy it.

207
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,750
And here, when it hits the ball, I create a key frame.

208
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,800
And create a bonus in animation as I did for the last LOTR.

209
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,820
Well, after that I go for rotating the ball to rotate the ball.

210
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,820
I don't use laser rotation.

211
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,700
That's because when the ball is in this state and it's stretched, if I rotate the ball, it takes a

212
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,760
bad form to prevent this problem.

213
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,770
I go to the shape contents.

214
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,820
By pricing control.

215
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:32,290
G I put all layers to a group and go to its transform and by using the rotation of the group, rotate

216
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,330
the ball correctly as you see.

217
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,350
Now when I wrote it, the ball that's problem doesn't happen anymore.

218
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,170
Let me increase the scale for a moment for you to completely notice as you see the direction of the

219
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,440
ball.

220
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,950
It doesn't change and only the shape layers rotate.

221
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,370
So I create a keyframe for the rotation of the group here.

222
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,000
Press you when it jumps.

223
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,100
Rotation is not needed here.

224
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,550
I want the ball to rotate from here until it gets here.

225
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,120
And rotates this way.

226
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,790
Let's see how it looks.

227
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,430
And from here it starts rotating this way.

228
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,240
It goes forward.

229
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,090
Rotates until here and continues rotating to lift.

230
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,530
I rotate this three times and see how it looks.

231
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,910
And here it goes back again.

232
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,980
Make this easy is.

233
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,540
And also easy is this one and increase its influence a little.

234
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,050
I hide this tape and see what the final animation looks like.

235
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,500
I think it's good.

236
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,440
Not bad.

237
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,000
This lesson took longer because we didn't use references.

238
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,180
And as you know, when we don't use references, we need to constantly check our timing, spacing and

239
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,890
the whole idea and edit them.

240
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:51,420
This is a time consuming effort, and the most important reason that made me do this exercise without

241
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:58,140
references is for you to don't always depend on references because you won't have references all the

242
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,480
time and you need to count on your creativity.

243
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:08,220
That's because as much as you use creativity in your animations and fantasize about them, you'll see

244
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,430
that you have created more attractive animation.

245
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,600
Good luck.
