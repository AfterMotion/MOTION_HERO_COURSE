00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,270
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,280
In this lesson, I want to explain how to create bouncing or spring animation, which is a basic animation

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,580
that every animator and motion designer needs to know about.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,330
I want to bring the cup from outside of the scene into the scene and create a bouncing animation for

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,320
its position.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,590
So isolate the main layer of the cup and to move the other layer with it.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,400
I parent them to this one.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,260
So I like these layers and pairing them to the couple here.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,810
Now, if I move the middle layer, you see that all layers move as one.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:47,620
I open its position, put it out of the scene, create a keyframe, go ten frames forward and bring

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,540
the cup to the center of the scene.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,500
Many motion designers who make this animation only make keyframes easy, and they are content with the

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,340
elements.

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,120
But to make your animation more appealing, it is better to give a bounce into your animation to do

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,420
so.

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,360
First, I need to copy and paste this key frame to the ending of the timeline so the final location

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,830
of the layer gets saved.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,630
Then I go to the second keyframes and bring the layer a little to the right.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,530
I go seven frames forward and bring it to the left.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,990
Again seven frames forward and bring the final location here.

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,170
Okay.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,700
Let's see how it looks.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,690
If you see your balance in speed is low, you can make the distance five frames.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240
I bring this one a little closer and this one goes here.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,570
If you want to have more bouncing, you can continue animating, move the layer this way and that,

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,440
and in each reciprocation, decrease distance between the keyframe and the final location of your layer.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,320
So as the animation gets to the end, the layer approaches more and more to the final destination,

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
and at the last it stands on the final location.

29
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,950
This is for when you want to create balancing for the position.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,870
If you want to do the same for rotation as well.

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,020
I already set my animation and I want to make balance in animation for this layer rotation.

32
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,720
To do this, I open rotation, create a keyframe for it, make it easy.

33
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:37,090
I move it two frames backward and after five frames rotate the layer this way, which means -25.

34
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,270
Again.

35
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,790
I go five frames forward here.

36
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,220
It must be on 25 frames.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,770
Forward seven -15.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,320
I decrease it by five each time.

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,170
I make the first keyframe linear, so now it has more speed at the beginning and move it a little backward.

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,640
It's better to increase the distance between these initial movements.

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,520
Until now, you have learned about creating bouncing animations manually.

42
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,280
To do this faster and more realistic.

43
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,570
It is better to use scripts that can increase your workflow speed.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,310
If you don't have access to these scripts, you can use expressions.

45
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,690
For this, I deliver rotation keyframes of this layer.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,810
I also click on the position of the cup layer and paste the bounce in expression here.

47
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,070
If I play now, bouncing is not really visible to work the bouncing expression properly on the animation.

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,870
The last keyframe needs to be linear, so I change this keyframe to linear.

49
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,490
As you see, the layer has a bounce, but it is too much.

50
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,080
It's roll bouncing.

51
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,490
You just need to change these values.

52
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,560
Amplitude is for the distance your layer takes from its main location.

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,660
For example, in this case, it comes to this point.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,250
If I put this on three.

55
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,480
You see, it goes further away from its main location.

56
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,060
Well, I said this on its original value.

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,750
Frequency, as its name implies, indicates the number of round trips of the layer.

58
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,390
I settled on one to have less frequency.

59
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,770
I think it is better on 1.5.

60
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,140
The K indicates energy reduction.

61
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,560
The more I increase it, the sooner energy decreases.

62
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,560
For example, I say to five.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
You see, it comes with their.

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,560
You can do the same for rotation.

65
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,370
I cut this expression.

66
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,940
So the layer loss is the bouncing effect and I go to the layer and animate this rotation.

67
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,350
I create a keyframe here, go a few frames back.

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,230
I always say that this way and make it easy.

69
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,900
So it's speed increases here.

70
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,830
I'll click on the rotation and paste the expression here.

71
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,900
Let's see how it looks.

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,790
As you see, the balancing that I've created for the cup is less noticeable here.

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,220
To improve it, I increase the amplitude.

74
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,290
And said they came on through to keep it more energetic.

75
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,770
You see, it is faster and more realistic than making it manually.

76
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
Good luck.
