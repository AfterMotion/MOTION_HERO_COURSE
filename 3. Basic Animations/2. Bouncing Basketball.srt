1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,780
In this lesson, I want to do another exercise on bouncing ball animation, which is more complicated

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,920
than the last one.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,940
But the difference between these two exercises is that I want to use references to create the animation,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,690
and that's because we have to get acquainted with how to use references from the beginning and create

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,240
the animations according to them, to get a better result.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,440
Well, I have found this image on the internet and I'll put it in the resources folder of this course

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,020
so you'll be able to use it.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,750
I have created a foolish decomp.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,130
I import the reference to the comp.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,860
The reference is small, so I increase its scale to 300 and make it bigger.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,030
And I bring it here because I want the animation to start from here.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,140
Let's go to create the ball as I did before.

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,730
First I import the ball texture.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,950
This time I use basketball and add this sphere effect to it.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,290
Decrease its radius to match the reference size.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,560
I think it's good.

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,690
As you see, I need to create the animation.

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,900
According to the reference, I open the position of the layer.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,060
First, I want to create the main keyframes of the animation.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,930
The first one is this one.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,030
The second one is here when it hits the ground.

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,250
The third one here, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth.

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,410
We have eight main keyframes.

24
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,010
First, I create these keyframes.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,490
To create this key frame.

26
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,740
I start counting from here to see in which frame I need to create the key frame.

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,260
This is the first frame.

28
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,060
So I bring the ball here in frame six.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,500
I go five frames forward and bring it here.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,640
Five firms ahead.

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,950
I bring it here.

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,210
I bring it here.

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,400
To make sure the Y position of this key frame is exactly like this one.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,420
I just need to double click on this key frame.

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,460
The Y position is one 905.

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,050
So I also set this one on 905 to be more accurate.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,870
Four frames forward.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,630
I bring it here again.

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,970
Four frames forward.

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,270
I bring it here.

41
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,770
After three frames.

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,060
It should be located here and at the end it comes here.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,680
After creating the main keyframes, we also have to create the animation path.

44
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,560
For this, I select these higher key frames.

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,830
Right click on them and enter keyframe interpolation.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,670
As I said before, this spatial interpolation is for the parts.

47
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:22,720
So I say on continuous busier to make sure when I change the handle, the other one moves with it so

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,030
the animation path doesn't get broken.

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,600
So I said it like this to make both handles grow with each other.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,360
As I'm holding one of the handles, I had all.

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,130
Let's see how it looks.

52
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,090
The overall animation has been created.

53
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,810
I just need to set the animation speed.

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,370
For this I select high key frames and make them easy.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,220
Now let's see how it is.

56
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:08,180
You see, it is a lot better to decrease the speed of the ball when it's in these high positions and

57
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,360
have a better look.

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,060
Isolate the keyframes.

59
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,990
Go to the graph editor and enable the speed graph.

60
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,550
Here I increase the handle approximately to 70.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,340
To do it.

62
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,070
More precisely, I go here and type in 74, both influences.

63
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,220
Now let's see how it is.

64
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,320
The problem here is that when the ball reaches this point, it gives a little pause, but we don't want

65
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,450
it to do so.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:06,180
I change this keyframe to continuous to bring both points higher together and I hold down shift and

67
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,680
bring it a little higher.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,440
So the animation speed is in zero here.

69
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,010
I do the same for this one too.

70
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,060
I enter it and set the speed on 100.

71
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,830
So this one on 300.

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,280
And also the last one on 100.

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,380
Okay.

74
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,820
It's a lot better.

75
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,070
Now I go for creating the squash and stretch for the ball.

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,930
When the ball is falling.

77
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,700
And here when it reaches its highest speed, it stretches like this.

78
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,860
And when it hits the ground, it squashes completely and looks like this.

79
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,900
And again, in the next frame, when it wants to go up, it stretches vertically.

80
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,470
And at this point, when speed is at its lowest, it gets back to its original form.

81
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,250
And again, when it comes here, it stretches vertically.

82
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,060
Here it squashes and this process repeats continuously until the end with the difference that when the

83
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,980
ball jumps less than before, the stretching and squishing effect, less on it.

84
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,940
I hide the reference one frame before the ball hits the ground.

85
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,260
It should stretch.

86
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,240
I open the scale and rotation of the layer, create the keyframe for them.

87
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Bring the keyframes to the beginning.

88
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:51,440
Here, the axes scale should decrease, I say on 70 and the same amount that I decreased from x, I

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
must add to Y.

90
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,950
So I set it on 130.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,740
And here the rotation should be in this direction in the next frame where the ball hits the ground.

92
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,900
Let me specify the floor.

93
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,760
I paste the first keyframe here and the ball needs to be squashed.

94
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:21,790
So here I said this one on 70 and this one on 130 and set the rotation on zero.

95
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,830
I press you to see the position keyframes when the ball squashes.

96
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,580
The position of this key frame also comes a little lower.

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,550
Again, I paste these key frames here with this difference that the rotation of the ball is toward this.

98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,980
Here.

99
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,190
Seven is too much.

100
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,150
So I settled on 75 and 125 to reduce stress a bit.

101
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,260
I also make the first keyframe of this scale easy.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,150
Here, the scale returns to its initial form, meaning 100.

103
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,450
Here When the ball lands, I copy these keyframes.

104
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,460
But reduce caution and bring the layer a bit lower.

105
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,420
One keyframe backward and I paste these keyframes here and change the rotation like this.

106
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,830
I paste these keyframes too, and set it on 80 and 120.

107
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,280
It comes here again and becomes 100.

108
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,360
And here again, I reduce this squash.

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,620
I this key frame of scale here.

110
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,390
Control C.

111
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,920
And control we.

112
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,440
I go to frames forward and scale goes to its original form and position comes higher.

113
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,520
Let's have a look and see how it is.

114
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,890
I made these keyframes linear so that the maximum stretch happens exactly one frame before hitting the

115
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,400
ground.

116
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,690
And not sooner.

117
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,020
I make these linear and bring them a little forward.

118
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,140
Och, it's good.

119
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,600
Well now I go for ball rotation for this.

120
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,050
I use the sphere effect and I want it to rotate like this toward the right.

121
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,440
So I create a keyframe for rotation.

122
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,270
Let me see what direction it must rotate.

123
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,880
I set this on minus two.

124
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,000
I praise you.

125
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,050
And I need to bring the second keyframe here.

126
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,760
So the ball rotates while being stretched and squashed.

127
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
Now if take a look.

128
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,710
You see that the ball moves exactly like the reference.

129
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,000
After creating the animation.

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,910
According to the reference, I can personalize the animation and create what I want easily.

131
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,980
In my opinion, the animation is a little bit fast.

132
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:32,770
I can slow it down so I go on second to select keyframes, hold down alt and drag the last keyframe

133
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,930
to increase animation duration.

134
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:46,660
When I increase the animation duration, as you see, the keyframes don't locate exactly on the frames

135
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,150
and locate somewhere between two frames, and such problems occur for the animation.

136
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,490
For example, here, when the ball is supposed to hit the ground, it is not on the ground.

137
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,310
To solve this problem, I just need to select these key frames and then align them with the frames.

138
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,960
Now I have the problem here.

139
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,900
These key frames must have only one frame distance before the ball hits the ground.

140
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,060
Let's see how it looks much better after I create the ball animation to make this scene.

141
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,500
I have created a basket here, so I make it visible.

142
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,560
I create a background.

143
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,820
Bring it down and add the gradient effect to it.

144
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,980
Change its color to dark purple.

145
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,190
Dark.

146
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,250
And the lower part?

147
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,950
A little.

148
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,900
Bring the sword point lower near here.

149
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,990
And bring the end point higher to create the scene like this.

150
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,530
After that, I want to create a reflection for the ball.

151
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,350
To do this, I add an adjustment layer.

152
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,450
At the mirror effect it.

153
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,550
And put the mirror point here.

154
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,470
I place the rule over the ground is bring the basket lower.

155
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,780
Go to the mirror effect.

156
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,000
And place its point here.

157
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:54,060
I go to the effect and set the angle to 90 degrees and set the opacity to seven.

158
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,270
Now if I play, you see, the reflection of the ball is on the ground.

159
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,100
The next thing I want to do is for the ball to stop under the basket.

160
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,170
Exactly here.

161
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,420
So what can I do about this?

162
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:25,770
If I change this keyframe, you see, the animation path falls apart to move the layer and its animation

163
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,880
path together.

164
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,250
I need to add another object to the scene.

165
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,850
Then pairing the basketball layer to it.

166
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,640
And now when I move the null object, you see that the layer and this animation path move together easily.

167
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,340
If I bring it here, for example, you see the animation moves with the layer.

168
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,450
After that I can delete the null object without any problem.

169
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,200
The next thing I want to do is that I want the blonde to enter the scene from outside.

170
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:03,770
For this, I go to the first keyframe of the position and bring it back and modify its path a little.
