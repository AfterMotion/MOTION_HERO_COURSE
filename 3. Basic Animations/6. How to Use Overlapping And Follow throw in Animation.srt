Hi.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,850
In this lesson, I want to talk about overlapping and follow through principles.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,820
Overlapping means that the movement of the attachment object, like this two layer attached to the top

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,290
layer, should have a delay compared to the main object.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,420
The follow through means that when the main object stops, the attachment object needs to continue its

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,340
movement like her movements, like necklace movements on the neck.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,570
When the head stops moving, they continue moving, as you see.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,210
Naturally, I have created an overlapping action for the layer here.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,920
The rotation should be on zero.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,360
Let me disable the expression for now.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
The length keyframes.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,530
When the cop layer moves, this layer shouldn't be straight like this and should have a delayed animation.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,170
So up here its rotation is this way.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,470
And when the main layer or the cop stops here, the animation of the attached layer continues.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,700
For example, until here it rotates this way and here it rotates the opposite direction.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,970
And at the end it is.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,970
Let's see how it became.

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,510
The movement of the year has a delay compared to the couple of year.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,150
And when the cop stops, the movement of the tiller continuous.

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,680
This delay of movement is called direct or overlapping.

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,520
And when the main layer stops and the attached layer keeps moving, this movement is called follow through.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,640
To do this with expression, I go to the beginning of the timeline where the rotation is zero.

23
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,950
I these this keyframes.

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,150
I come here and create a keyframe for rotation.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,790
And here I drag it backward and make this key frame easy, ease and finally enable expression.

26
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,610
Well, let's see how it is.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,910
Here.

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:07,810
When the main lawyer is moving, the lawyer says back and when it stops, the lawyer keeps moving and

29
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,490
follow through is happening.

30
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,340
I should do the same here.

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,890
It needs to move a bit backwards.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,830
When the player moves backward, the player needs to rotate, right?

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,330
So I create a keyframe for its rotation here and make it easy.

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,240
Here.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,830
It rotates this way.

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,040
And when it goes here with to the left.

37
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,440
To improve the animation.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,420
I bring the keyframes frames a bit forward so that overlapping happens better.

39
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,520
Let's see the whole animation once more.

40
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,410
Okay.

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,410
It is good.

42
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,670
Until now, you have learned about squash and strange anticipation, overlapping and follow through

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,810
principles.

44
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,470
Trying to use these principles in creating your animations because they help a lot to make your animations

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,400
attractive.

46
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,310
Note that the principles of animation are 12, which I have talked about, important ones that are easy

47
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,330
to use and help to make your animation appealing.

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,000
And in the future, I will talk about all 12 principles completely and you will learn about their benefits

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,190
and applications.

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Good luck.
