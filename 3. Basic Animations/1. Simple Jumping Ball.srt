00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,820
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,560
In this chapter, as I said, I want to talk about basic animations.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:13,850
One of the most basic and important animations that the animator must know is bouncing ball animation.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,190
You may think, what is the point of bouncing ball animation or why do we have to start from bouncing

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,390
ball animation?

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,620
I have to say practice in bouncing ball animation may look simple and very easy at first, but in fact

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,740
you can learn about important principles of animation in this exercise.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,640
In the simplest case, I can say you will learn about timing, spacing, objects, weights or squash

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,540
and stretch.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,500
And it's not like the bouncing ball animation is just for knowing about these principles, but it's

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,610
also used in professional animations to have an overview of timing and character states before drawing.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,960
In the beginning, the bouncing ball of the scene is created and then according to that timing, the

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,850
character is animated.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,540
That's why bouncing ball animation is important and any animator has to practice it from the start so

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,660
that when he wants to start animating professionally, like character animation, be able to use these

16
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,920
principles which have learned from here and get the intended result.

17
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,810
Before starting, I recommend that you open after Effects right now.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,340
Open the Simple Jumping Ball project and follow me step by step.

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,940
Let's start creating a simple bouncing ball.

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,860
To do that, I make a foolish comp and name it bouncing ball.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:52,000
I set its frame rate on 24 gray for background and duration and 2 seconds after that to make it attractive,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,280
I import the image of a soccer ball.

23
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:05,370
I bring it into the comp and place it here and to turn this texture into an orb, I use the sphere effect.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,430
I had the effect, the layer.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,820
And as you see, the texture turns into a ball in the rotation section.

26
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,780
If I change these values, you see the layer completely acts as a ball.

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,860
I go to the lighting, I set the light high to 100.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,870
Bring this 1 to 0.

29
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,280
In shaving ice the amount to 100 so that the ball doesn't have a shadow.

30
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,820
Of refuse to zero.

31
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,520
I bring them the radius to 100.

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,190
I put a ruler down here as a floor and saw the animating.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,980
I also want to create this conscience.

34
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,740
And so it is better to put the layer anchor point here under the ball.

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,490
I create a keyframe for its position at the beginning of the timeline.

36
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,120
And then in frame 12, I bring the ball up.

37
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,700
And again, you stick in one.

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,750
I past the first keyframe frame.

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,460
I turn the work area here and take a look at the animation.

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,890
The animation is completely linear and it's not much appealing.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,920
That's why easy is the middle key frame.

42
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,650
It's better little to improve it.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,890
I go to the graph editor in a speed graph and increase handles of this keyframe until their influence

44
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,360
reaches 100.

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,430
Let's have a look.

46
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,810
Much better to have a more intense jump when the ball hits the ground.

47
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,810
I reduce these handles.

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,350
After that, I go for the rotation of the ball.

49
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,700
For this I go to the sphere if I want the ball to rotate this way and forward.

50
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,690
For this I create a keyframe at the beginning of the timeline.

51
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,830
I press Yuki to make its keyframe visible and at the end, because I want it to rotate forward.

52
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,720
I set this to minus one.

53
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,400
Let's see how it looks.

54
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,860
It's very good to make a shadow for it.

55
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,480
I use the Ellipse to.

56
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,010
Here.

57
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,400
I hold down control so that the shape is created from the center and I create a shape the same size

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
as the ball.

59
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,940
I move it below the ball layer.

60
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,000
Decrease its capacity, and I want to animate its scale.

61
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,260
I create a key frame for it here.

62
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,360
And when the ball is up, I settled on 40.

63
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,900
And when it comes down, I paste the first keyframe here again.

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,460
I want the influence of this keyframe to be exactly like this one so that the shadow and ball have the

65
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,420
same speed.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,210
That's why we right click on this keyframe and go to the keyframe velocity.

67
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,180
As you see, the speed is zero and both influences are 100 on incoming and outgoing.

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,540
So I select this keyframe and make it easy.

69
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,280
Go to the key frame velocity and set influence on 100 for incoming and outgoing.

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's see how it looks.

71
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,470
As you see the shadows.

72
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,260
Speed is synchronized with the ball speed.

73
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,050
After that, I go for creating squash and stretch for the ball.

74
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,220
For this.

75
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,760
Isolate the ball player, hold down, shift and press is to open the scale to.

76
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,280
I create the first keyframe here because the scale of the ball should be 100 here.

77
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,570
And when it hits the ground, the ball should be a little bit squashed.

78
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,100
So I increase the axis scale to 120.

79
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,990
And decrease the Y scale to the same amount that I increased the scale.

80
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,360
So I changed 100 to 80.

81
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,620
And in the next frame it reverses.

82
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,970
This becomes 90 and this becomes 110.

83
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,920
And in the last keyframe, it needs to be like this.

84
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,610
And in the previous frame like this, I also make this key frame easy ease.

85
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,050
And let's have a look.

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,170
Well, I have made this question stretch to improve it a little bit.

87
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:11,350
I can set this on 125 and this 1 to 75, so it squashes a little more.

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,350
And also here, 85 and 115.

89
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,860
As you see, when the ball is on the ground, it is squashed and when it comes up it stretches.

90
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,330
And as it goes higher, changes back to its original form.

91
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,460
And when it is coming down, it stretches and gets squashed here again.

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,070
Let's have a look.

93
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,070
It is really good to make our work more attractive.

94
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,930
I create a shape here.

95
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,650
I change its color to green?

96
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,930
Duplicated, bring it higher and make it a little darker.

97
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,750
And after that, isolate both layers and put them into come and call it flow.

98
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,210
Then I go to the comp.

99
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,680
Change the size, the layer size.

100
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,830
Crop it and go back to the main crop.

101
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,920
Bring it down and place it here.

102
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,060
And to animate it.

103
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,310
I use the motion tile effect.

104
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,430
I create a key frame here?

105
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,510
And another one here.

106
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,030
Let me bring it down.

107
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,410
It is a little fast, so I decrease this.

108
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,720
To make the ground is physical.

109
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,750
I use the optic compensation effect and add it to the ground.

110
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,980
I increase it a little and bring this one down.

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,620
And to fix these cropped parts, I use the reptile effect.

112
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,730
I bring it above the optic effect and increase its right and left.

113
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
To make this scene more beautiful.

114
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,050
I have created a football gate.

115
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,040
I increase its size and bring it below the floor layer and bring it down.

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,540
And I said, the color of these grasses, the same as the floor, but a little bit darker and increase

117
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
their scale.

118
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,780
And put them below the floor layer.

119
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,900
The benefit of using a sphere to make this ball and its rotation is that later you can go to the project

120
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,150
panel, find the texture and by the replace for this option, give another texture to your ball.

121
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,170
As you see now, a basketball is animating.

122
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,690
Let me change rotation so it gets more obvious.

123
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,800
Also, you can do it again and replace another texture.

124
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,150
In the next lesson, I'll talk about another kind of bouncing ball animation, which is a little more

125
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,690
professional and harder to create.

126
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,120
So you get familiar with different kinds of animations.
