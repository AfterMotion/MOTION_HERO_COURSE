1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,510
Well, the next thing to consider in your animation is that before any action you need to do anticipation,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,190
which is one of the principles of animation.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,540
I will explain all the animation principles in the next lessons, what they are and what are they used

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,070
for.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,950
But then this lesson I just want to talk about the anticipation principle because it has a great impact

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,550
on animations attraction, and most motion designers ignore it and this makes their motion graphics

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,990
not much attractive.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,730
Okay, let's go for making anticipation for my animation to do this.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,640
When this cop enters the scene, I want it to go out again in sequence three.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,230
Many motion designers for doing this make only one keyframe for the position.

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,520
Make it easy, easy.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,140
And for example, after ten frames, they put it out so simple.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,190
It comes in.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,330
And goes out in order to make our animation more attractive and prepare the audience for its exit.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,390
I will create anticipation to do this.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,850
I delete the second keyframe for now.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,460
Go seven frames forward and bring the cup slightly back and again ten frames later we drag the cob out

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,180
of the scene.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,300
As you see, this backward movement of the club prepares the audience for the cops intention to exit.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,790
I make the last keyframe linear, so at the end it's speed increases.

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,480
To make it more attractive.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,330
You can reduce the speed of the middle keyframe.

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,550
Pay attention.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,990
That anticipation of an animation depends on the layers movement.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,610
If your layer moves to the right, like in here, usually anticipation is toward the left.

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,250
If your layer wants to move up, anticipation should be downward.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,690
If it's going to rotate right, it should have left anticipation.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,160
For example I will create a rotation animation to.

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,170
I put a ruler here and rotate this.

30
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,120
Here, I move a bit higher and for rotation and position movements to be synchronized, I have to equalize

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,900
the speed.

32
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,200
For this I make these two key frames easy.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,210
Ease and Intergraph editor.

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:45,830
I said the influence of the position keyframe to 70 and also set the rotation on 70, so they move accordingly.

35
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,430
As you see this correct now.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,260
And here I would say it like this and say, don't sin and make it linear.

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay, let's see how it became.

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,710
And this better.

39
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,250
We can increase rotation again, bring position higher so its anticipation is more visible.

40
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,850
It comes in.

41
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,840
And goes out.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,330
In the next lesson, I will talk about the overlap in principle.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,350
Good luck.
