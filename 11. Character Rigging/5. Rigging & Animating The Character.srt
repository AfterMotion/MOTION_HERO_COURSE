1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,510
After I'm done scrutinizing the character, I move on to parenting the layers, to the skeletons.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,120
To do that, the characters are always or must be parented to the right arm.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,960
Skeleton.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,900
Which is this layer and also the other parts must be parented to their related skeletons.

5
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,630
After parents in different parts of the character to the skeletons, the components of the face such

6
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:56,620
as the glasses, eyes, eyebrows, nose and the mouth must be parented to the head layer.

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,220
Also, this part of the hair must be parented to the head.

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,750
After that, isolate the skeletons by hitting the selected structures option in the Links and Constraints

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,660
section, I click on the order option.

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,530
I get back to the topic again in the structure panel.

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,820
Hit the show and hide option to completely hide the structures.

12
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,460
As you can see, the character is perfectly right now.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,960
After doing that to animate the character, I just need to go to the automation panel and use the work

14
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,810
cycle tool before I apply the work cycle tool.

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
I go to settings to make sure that the work cycle has identified the controllers.

16
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,430
I will check the controllers once more to make sure they are properly defined here.

17
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,810
So this is the right arm controller and it's defined correctly here.

18
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,080
As you see, all the controllers are properly identified here.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
Let's get back.

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,520
Isolate the controllers and click on the work cycle.

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,170
Once I have the walk cycle, you'll see that the character starts to walk.

22
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,150
But her gait is the opposite.

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,460
To fix this movement.

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,980
I go to the main parameters in the work cycle section and remove this negative.

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
And now the character moves forward.

26
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,850
The problem here is that the left hand rotation angle is not correct.

27
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,130
To fix it, isolate the controller.

28
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,130
And here the reverse is no longer functional.

29
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,970
Because when I apply the work cycle, as you see the arms controller exits the IK mode and sets to the

30
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,870
f k mode.

31
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,180
To solve this problem.

32
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,090
I go to the individual control.

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,460
I hit the key and go to the beginning.

34
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,610
Since the key frames were created here and I start rectifying the characters or mangle.

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,220
Let's move to the work cycle settings.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,270
As you see, the character legs are bent in all positions.

37
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,430
Well, when the character is in this post, this leg must be straight.

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,790
To fix this problem, isolate the body controller and bring the character up a little.

39
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's check you out.

40
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,700
It got a little better now.

41
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,310
I think the hands still need a little look to find.

42
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,620
I go to the arms controller.

43
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,070
I go to the work site setting.

44
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,870
Then go to character.

45
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,990
I increased the energy bit to make the character more flexible.

46
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,880
And second control in body.

47
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,560
I change 5 to 3 to reduce the up and down movement of the body.

48
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,370
In the legs.

49
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,930
I increased the height.

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,000
As you can see, it affects the lifting of the legs.

51
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,740
I say to 100.

52
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,050
The pacing interval is a bit short.

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,410
So I go to the walk cycle and increase this.

54
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,210
The energy is a bit high.

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,060
I said it's in its own default value.

56
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,760
The body must go higher.

57
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,850
Let's check it out.

58
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,550
I should reduce this a bit more.

59
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,080
More with over.

60
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,970
To make the head move more, I increase this.

61
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,890
And as for the arms, I said this to Tim.

62
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,730
Let me hide the controller so I know exactly what's going on.

63
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,940
The body must be moved a little further.

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,440
I move the body furthermore, to make it better.

65
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,460
Let me set the bar.

66
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,580
So in the six to see if it gets better or not.

67
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,030
I reduced this a little.

68
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,070
Increase this.

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,310
And said hi to 70.

70
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,920
To prevent this line from getting on her leg.

71
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,810
I bring this layer on top of the body.

72
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,050
I can go here and to reduce the walking pace, increase this a little.

73
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,410
I set it to 230.

74
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,840
I think 210 is better.

75
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,090
As you see, I was able to read and animate the character without creating any keyframes using the basil.

76
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:59,060
To get acquainted with all the tools and abilities that the person provides you for animating and rigging

77
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,100
the character.

78
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,440
I suggest you watch the discourse on rigging the character using the pestle, which can really be useful

79
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,480
to beginners who want to become professional in rigging and animating the characters.
