00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,160
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,300
In this chapter, I'm going to talk about character writing, which is what should we do?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,720
So then we can easily animate our characters.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,460
Creating a skeleton and controllers for a character is called Reading.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,270
The purpose is to be able to animate our character with the least controller, not to animate all the

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,840
layers.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,370
For a simple animation, which is really hard work.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,250
There are different plugins and scripts for rigging characters, but I can say that the most popular

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,870
of them is doing because first of all, it is free and it is updated every year and it has many useful

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,140
tools for rigging and animating the character.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,620
In this chapter, which is the subject of our discussion on character rigging, we get familiar with

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,260
the panels and options related to the skeleton and rigging the character in detail.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,960
And in the next chapter, which is about animating the character, you will learn how to create an auto

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:09,450
cycle animation for your character in the easiest way, and then you will learn how to create a cycle

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,140
of walking and running in a principal way and with the help of resources from the Internet.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,140
Well, let's look at how to install the script.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,890
To download the script, you can download it from our x laboratory dot org or use the file I put in

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,600
the resource of this course.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,430
After downloading the script, we extract the compressed file.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,250
We go to the person two folder.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,020
As you can see, there are a few files and folders which will work with these two folders optional panels

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,100
which in that you can install each one of these panels individually.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:56,190
Or you can go to this UI panels folder and you can have all those panels by copying this file in the

24
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,800
scripts folder of your after effects.

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,140
Well, because I want the full version of the script.

26
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:13,170
I copy this file and go into my computer, drive C programs, file Adobe after Effects 2020 Support

27
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,070
files.

28
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,130
And in script folder a script UI panels and pasted.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,420
After we've done this, we go in after effects.

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:35,420
And if you want to run the scripts first, we should go to edit menu preferences, scripting and expression.

31
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,810
And here we should enable allow script option.

32
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,810
And after that you can find Basil two in the Windows menu and run it.

33
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,540
Then we see a panel appears here.

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,750
Let me on deck this and you can go to the imports by clicking on this option and see it stalls.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,360
At the end, you can set your cell panel by dragging its panel anywhere you want.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
Good luck.
