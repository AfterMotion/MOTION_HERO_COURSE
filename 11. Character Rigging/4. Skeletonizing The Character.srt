Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,590
You might think that reading and animating a character is very difficult, but in this video I will

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,080
show you how easy it can be to rig and animate a character using the basil.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
This is the result I want to get to at the end.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,200
Let's get the sonnet.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,200
The first thing I need from Regan is a character.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,150
After downloading the character.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,930
What I need to do is to make the joints of the character simpler so that no problem happens to the joints

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,100
while telling them.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,110
As you see, I have made all join circular.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,570
After that, I will go to the Duke and create the skeletons for it.

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,720
You must make sure that the anchor point of this skeleton is exactly on the layers Anchor point.

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,400
To do.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,710
So I use this snapping tool.

15
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:39,930
To create the left arm skeleton, isolate these skeletons and duplicate them in the bezel and to rename

16
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,620
the layers.

17
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,440
I go to the tool section and then rename.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,950
I want to remove two characters from the end of the names, so I insert tool here and also I want to

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,650
add live and an underline in the beginning.

20
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,820
I also want to name these layers for the right arm skeleton.

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,770
So I add this to the beginning.

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,120
I bring this skeleton here?

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,440
I don't need this.

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,040
I enable the snapping and put the layers into place.

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,570
After doing that, I move on to create the skeletons for the body.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
The body consists of several parts.

27
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,990
First, the head.

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,310
Second, the chest.

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,960
Third, the neck and forth.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,440
The head.

31
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,320
Therefore, I go to the spine settings.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,980
I need a skeleton for the head.

33
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,690
One for the neck.

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,760
One for the spine.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,290
And one for the hip.

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,490
Isolate the created layers along with the body, head, neck and hip layers.
