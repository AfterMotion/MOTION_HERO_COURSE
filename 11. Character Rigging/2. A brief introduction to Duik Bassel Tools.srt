1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,070
Since in this course I used the script for reading and scrutinizing my character.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,500
It's better before I start ruining my character.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,920
I get to know the best script and tones I use in this course generally.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,870
So when I started the training and I started to rig the character, I don't have any kind of ambiguity.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,910
First, I run the best.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,930
As soon as I run the vessel, a panel will be shown to us, which is Welcome to the vessel.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:42,140
Here I can see different panels of the Basil reading panel, Automation's animation camera and tool.

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,820
I go into the rigging panel and when the creating structures option is enabled, you can see options

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,340
about scrutinizing your character.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,140
The first option is harmony, which creates a fully structure in the skeleton of the human body.

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,430
As you can see, skeletons have been created and here I can see layers related to these skeletons.

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,340
Well, I go back to the puzzle.

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,210
I have control Z.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,510
So I go back to the first estate.

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,760
Well, the next options are the arm, leg, spine and tail.

16
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,050
These panels are for creating skeletons for those parts.

17
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,290
These options are used when you want to manually create the skeletons for those parts.

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,100
If I go into the setting of each one of these options, you can see there are three options.

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,920
The first one is for animals that are similar to humans like bears and bunnies.

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,160
The next option is for animals with claws, and the next option is for hoofed animals.

21
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,790
The law shows the form of a skeleton, and here you can select what kind of escalation you need for

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,690
your characters.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,960
For example, if you want the shoulder bone, you should enable the shoulder.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,120
And if you don't disable it.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,160
And in part you want here, you can have it by enabling the related option.

26
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,170
If I enable close, you can see the hand parts of animals with claws will show.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,690
For example, I need these three parts and then I click on Create.

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,430
As you see, three skeletons have been created for me.

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,750
The next option I should explain is duplicate.

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
This option is used for duplicating the skeletons you have created.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,080
For example, I created this skeleton and I want to duplicate this form and shape.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,250
If I do this by tapping on control D, you can see that it gets ruined.

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,470
To avoid this, isolate the skeletons and use the duplicate option.

34
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:06,040
And if I drag it to this side, you can see that the skeletons are duplicated correctly by the same

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,120
shape and form.

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:16,090
In the end, I have the other option which I have in the link and constraint panel to this option is

37
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,480
for rig in your character skeleton automatically.

38
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,560
Let me delineate these layers and let's create a harmonized skeleton.

39
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,900
Let me first note that the skeleton I created is not great at all.

40
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,980
As you can see, when I move the hip bone, none of the skeletons affects another and they are completely

41
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,690
detached.

42
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,050
But if I select all of the skeletons and go into a bezel and use order in this structure panel or I

43
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:53,490
go to the rig and constraint panel and use the rig, you can see that my character is completely rigged

44
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,400
and controllers have been created for it.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,350
And in that timeline, new layers have been created whose colors are green, and every one of them initially

46
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,270
has a C in their phrases, meaning they are the controller players.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,190
And now if you pay attention, if I move the hip, every other part of the skeleton is affected and

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,710
moved by this movement and they are completely rigged or attached to each other.

49
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,000
I go back to the person and the next option I should explain is zero.

50
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,700
By this option we can zero the layers position without changing its location.

51
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,160
So I can easily get back my layer or controller to its first position.

52
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,590
For example, isolate this controller and click on zero.

53
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,710
As you can see, its position is zero.

54
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:58,070
And now it doesn't matter how much I move this controller, if I want it back to its first place, is

55
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,410
enough to change its position to zero.

56
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,550
As you can see, it gets back to its first place.

57
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:13,100
Well, the next panel is automation, which has auxiliary tools for creating different animations.

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,650
The next panel is the animation, which is related to keyframes and animation.

59
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,080
And this panel, you can easily control different kinds of keyframes and their graphs.

60
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,560
The next panel is related to the camera movements.

61
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,570
And the last panel is the tool which you can have different tools here.

62
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,440
I will give a general explanation about the rename tool because I'm going to use them during this chapter.

63
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,530
This tool, as it's obvious from its name, it's for naming the layers more easily.

64
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,120
For example, this is the skeleton of my character's left hand.

65
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,280
Isolated and I want to delete number two, which is on the end of these layers.

66
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,660
For this.

67
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,670
I click on the last option and then type two, meaning two characters from the list of my layers.

68
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,730
Names should be removed.

69
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,100
So I type two and click on rename.

70
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,940
As you can see, two are deleted.

71
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,770
And if I want to add a letter at the first of the layers names, for example, I want to add a URL,

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,850
meaning these skeletons belong to my character's left hand.

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,780
I use the prefix option and here I add l and then underline and then click on rename.

74
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,740
As you can see, L is added to my layers.

75
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,400
If I want to change my lawyer's name completely.

76
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,090
It's enough to write here.

77
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,970
And for example, as you can see, all of the layers are renamed to hand.

78
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,300
And if I want to rename all layers to hand.

79
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,210
But number two, it's enough to check the number box and then click on rename.

80
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,320
As you can see, all of the layers are renamed to hand with numbers in order at the end of them.

81
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,650
The suffix option is used for adding a character at the end of the layers names.

82
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,590
For example, I had a space and I left.

83
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,790
Let me delete this one too, so it doesn't add again.

84
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,320
Then I click on rename.

85
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,190
As you can see, lift is added to the ends of my layers.

86
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,630
Names and numbers are placed after them.

87
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,320
I had control Z disable number and again I click on rename.

88
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,990
As you can see, the lift is added at the end of the layers.

89
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,290
Remove The first option is used for removing a character from the first.

90
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, I click on this and type two to remove two characters from the first of my layers name.

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,820
If I want the added left to be removed, I type five and remove the last.

92
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,740
And remove the lift I added here so it doesn't add again.

93
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,680
As you can see, Labor's name are back to what they were.

94
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,440
Well, it's enough so far.

95
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,130
Now we are familiar with the options we want to work with.
