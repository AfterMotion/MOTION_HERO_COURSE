00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,080
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,720
It must have occurred to you that you want to read and animate the character, but realize that the

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,900
character is not designed for the rig and animate and eventually your animation will have problems when

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,340
rotating the joints.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,500
So in this video, I want to talk about how you can prepare characters for rigging.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Well, I open the file that I've downloaded from free pick.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,380
Since I need this character.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,460
I select the rest, cut them and paste them into a new layer using control, shave and hide it.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,590
First of all, I need to set the art world.

10
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,830
Isolate the character and resize it.

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,700
After doing so, it's time to separate the different parts of the character and put them in individual

12
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,450
layers.

13
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,180
I don't need this back, so I delete it.

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,640
I cut this part of the arm.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,480
Paste it into a new layer and name it writes are.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,770
Then I do the same for the rest of the parts and put them in individual layers.

17
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,210
For her hand.

18
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,680
I use this layer.

19
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,310
After that's done, I need to save the file.

20
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,140
Then I go to After Effects and import the intended file.

21
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,390
I import it as a composition and layer size.

22
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,670
Afterward, I go to the camp.

23
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,310
I don't need this layer anymore.

24
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,370
I also hide the left leg and left arm for now.

25
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,430
Now I have to work on creating the different parts of the lake, isolate the right click and convert

26
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,500
it to shape to create joints properly.

27
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,450
First, I need to select the layer and choose the Ellipse tool, and here is where the thigh joints

28
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,470
should be placed.

29
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,700
So I make a circle right here.

30
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,700
It should exactly fit the leg shape.

31
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,830
I disabled the stroke.

32
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,270
I move down a little bit.

33
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,990
The ne part should be around right here.

34
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,420
So I make another circle here.

35
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,920
I change its color so it would be obvious.

36
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,900
Then I go for creating the joint of the ankle.

37
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,150
It should be made right here.

38
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,190
Then I duplicate this layer twice and specify the different parts of the lake.

39
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,970
In the land of the thigh.

40
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,410
I remove the shapes that I don't need.

41
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,820
I create a point here and another one here, and I remove these parts.

42
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,150
I also create the point here and another here and move it a little.

43
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,370
And I delete these.

44
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,480
I don't need this.

45
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,030
Then I changed the color of the joint to the color of the main layer.

46
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,410
For this part.

47
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,440
I don't need the side parts, so I delete them.

48
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,590
I changed the color of the joints to the color of their sides shapes.

49
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,570
Well, let's work on the food part.

50
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,840
I like the unnecessary shapes.

51
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,380
I and hide this shoe layer and convert it to shape.

52
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,130
Then I copy shapes and paste him into the write for the layer and I placed them right where they should

53
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,520
be.

54
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,810
Then I delete the previous layer.

55
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,100
After that, I should place the anchor points right in the center of the joints.

56
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,480
For doing so, I just have to hide all the shapes except for the joints.

57
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,400
Then I hold control and double click on the pan behind tool.

58
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,050
As you can see, the anchor point will be placed right in the center of the shape.

59
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,250
Then I can unhide the layers.

60
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,180
I do the same for these joints as well.

61
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,540
As you see, once I rotate the joints, I don't face any problems at all.

62
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,420
To prevent this.

63
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,700
I put this above the skin layer.

64
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,590
Then I layer to the thigh layer and the foot layer to additional layer.

65
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,930
Then I rotate the leg so it would be in a straight line.

66
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,740
After doing so, I duplicate the layers and use them for the left leg.

67
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,230
I moved forward right here.

68
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,850
And for it to have a different color, I add the little effect to it.

69
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,490
I face the same effect for the other layers as well.

70
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,280
I also have to remove this line.

71
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,390
After that, I also have to create the hip part.

72
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,190
To do so, I convert the body layer into a shape.

73
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,490
Ideally the previous layer.

74
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,570
Inside these isolate the body layer and create the hip.

75
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,830
I move this lately a little further so it would match with the hip.

76
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,100
The anchor point of the body should be right here.

77
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,250
Okay.

78
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,550
The next thing is working on the arms.

79
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,500
As you can see here, the joints are circular shapes, but the problem is that it's not possible to

80
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,620
place the anchor points precisely in the center of the joints for fixing this.

81
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,440
I need to convert it to shape and add a circle right here.

82
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,230
After doing so, I can easily place the anchor point in the center of the joints.

83
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,850
I do the same for the knee and the ankle.

84
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,470
And now once I wrote it, then it works well.

85
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,620
The problem here is that the size of the arm doesn't match with the forearm.

86
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,660
So I need to fix this.

87
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,980
For doing so.

88
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:52,380
Isolate the arm shape and delete this point and make it smaller so it would be the same size as disjoint.

89
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,890
If you give it a look, you can see that it's working properly.

90
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,060
I delete this shape to.

91
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,190
Then I parent the hand to the forearm and the forearm to the arm.

92
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,430
And place them in a straight line.

93
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,290
Then I duplicate these layers and use them for live.

94
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,710
I moved the layers right here.

95
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,530
Then I placed him under the lake layers.

96
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,310
Oh, I missed the point that I should have separated the toes as well for doing so.

97
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,160
I duplicate this layer and name it toes.

98
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,350
Then I saw these two shapes.

99
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,680
Firstly, I make the toes part.

100
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,660
Its anchor point should be placed right here.

101
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,620
I hide this layer.

102
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,790
This part of the phone has to rotate this much.

103
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,180
So I need to extend this shape up until here.

104
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,410
And now once I rotate it, you can see that there wouldn't be any sort of problem.

105
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,250
Okay.

106
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,700
I have to do the same for the other four to.

107
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,550
And the anchor point of the head should be right here.

108
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,540
And finally, if you're interested in character reading and you want to learn how to read all character

109
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:10,230
parts and the expressions which are needed in this context and once for all, make yourself needless

110
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,890
and read in the character, I recommend you watch this course.
