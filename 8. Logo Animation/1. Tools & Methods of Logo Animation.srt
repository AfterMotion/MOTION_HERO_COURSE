00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,300
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,680
In this video, I want to talk about one of the most attractive parts of motion graphics logo animation.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,290
And his widow.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:20,020
We will talk about all kinds of logo animations, how we can create them and the tools we can use for

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,100
creating them.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,920
The first thing we should know is that we can create logo animations by two methods.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,160
The first one, which is the fastest, is using templates and the second one is custom.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,840
In the first method we go to video five dot net select the project that we think it is suitable for

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,330
our job and then put our logo in it.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,620
We can also change the color if needed and eventually we render it and create our logo animation.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,580
This method is more suitable for business managers and beginners who have just started motion graphics

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,600
and want to create their logo animation as soon as possible and they don't care about it being so unique

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,710
and special.

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,120
They should know that if some of these templates are so beautiful and detailed, yet they are not a

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,780
good option for some of the projects because they are not personalized at all and they express no meaning

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,590
about the brand or its productivity.

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,130
And it is also so hard to find a good quality project and what you really want between a lot of templates

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,730
and if you do, probably some people before have used it already, and when a customer sees that they

19
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:46,170
think you are a lazy or amateur motion graphics designer, well the second method of creating logo animations

20
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,050
is a little bit harder and more complicated to create custom logo animations.

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,260
And this method look animation should be created exclusively and relatively for customer purposes and

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,520
its work area.

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,950
So it is not like templates.

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,880
So we could use it for many customers and because it is exclusive and it has been made for a particular

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,810
brand and it is explaining about that, it can be a very good tool for the brand marketing.

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,700
Well, it is obvious that in this video our topic is the second method, because the first method it

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,110
is not professional.

28
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,760
It is even so simple.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,650
It doesn't need instruction.

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,550
After getting acquainted with the ways of creating logo animations, it is better than at first.

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,250
We get to know all kinds of logo animations and the tools we can create them with.

32
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,450
That's first.

33
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,970
Before we can create a logo animation, we should have a logo.

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:56,880
We need to design a logo that can be designed in different ways and shapes like geometric, abstract

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
and etc..

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,280
And then for animating them, we can choose hard or easy ways.

37
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,290
The first and the simplest way to make logo animations is by using lines.

38
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,040
And this way we use exactly the same effects and do what we did for making lettering animations.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,940
But differences here lines form the logo shapes.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,620
Changing pathways can also help a lot for creating this kind of animation.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,180
We can use shape reformers, especially tree path.

42
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,550
We can use effects like stroke, 3D stroke, track maps, and also curve a plugin which is particular

43
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,960
for this kind of works.

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,990
As you know, it is right that we are working with lines here, yet it doesn't mean because we are only

45
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,020
using lines.

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,530
Our work won't be attractive enough.

47
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,070
As you can see, with a little bit of taste, creativity and creation, we can create really beautiful

48
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,440
logo animations with these lines.

49
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,930
We have talked about lines.

50
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,530
Maybe you have already seen these kinds of logo animations which have been made by lines for these kinds

51
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,260
of works.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,850
Connect Layer Script is going to be really useful for you for creating these connections.

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,610
It is enough to select the layers and click on the tree button.

54
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,130
After animating the layers, you can see that the lines are connected to them.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,430
Of course, we can use other plugins for creating these kinds of work which are more advanced but not

56
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,810
free like plex's.

57
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,460
The next method, which is very interesting, is the Lego components shown by them impacting together

58
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,750
or to the surface.

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,930
For example, at the first animation, a circle goes into the scene and by meeting the logo components

60
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,980
and then logo components meeting to each other creates a logo.

61
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,020
We can say that our team's logo has been created with this method.

62
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,050
There are many tools we can use in this method, like changing the layers transform like changing rotation

63
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,470
position scale.

64
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,420
Scale is really important because layers bouncing animation depends on that and you should pay attention

65
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,820
a lot to the anchor points places because they have a big part in bouncing.

66
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,490
The next tools we can use are a squash and a stretch.

67
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,060
Changing pathways which it is used for changing objects shape.

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,480
Train path the former.

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:38,270
3D stroke and also warp and band effects, which are really handy for bending objects and making objects

70
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,350
look soft.

71
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,900
The next method is the glitch.

72
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,380
As you know, there are many kinds of glitches like moving pixelation, fragmentation of the logo and

73
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,930
its colors and other different kinds.

74
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,300
You can use all of the glitch coins in this method.

75
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,820
There are many ways to create glitch, and so far many plugins, scripts and templates have been created

76
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,310
which you can use to create glitchy.

77
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,180
I repeat the last point I told you, because it is so important in using methods you get familiar with

78
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,110
now or before.

79
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,560
Be a little bit cautious and consider its brand and work field.

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,830
Then use one of the methods.

81
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,740
So you should understand this kind of animation is related to what brand or field?

82
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,460
For example, if there is a company that is technology related, this kind of animation might be suitable

83
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,120
for it.

84
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,220
But if your customers field is meditation or cooking, there is no need to use glitch for that logo.

85
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,710
But if your customer likes it, you can use it.

86
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,490
A lot of people like these kind of logo animations.

87
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,460
Tools that we can use to create glitches are effects like turbulence, displaced displacement, map

88
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,690
noise, noise, less Venetian blinds, mosaic shift channel and posterized time.

89
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,600
The next method is using geometries and playing with geometric shapes.

90
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,010
And this method, simple things happen.

91
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:24,060
But because objects are scattered and in one moment a few objects go into the scene and are animating.

92
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,180
They make our work look professional and beautiful.

93
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,700
For creating these kind of logo animations.

94
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,450
As you can see in these examples, it is enough to imagine your logo to geometric shapes and then appear

95
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,620
each part with the geometric shape and combine those geometries.

96
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,770
So eventually your logo can take a shape.

97
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,380
You should be aware that you shouldn't disrupt scene balance, meaning we don't want our logo to be

98
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,140
so dynamic in some parts and not in other parts.

99
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,700
In other words, logo animations should be fully framed, meaning movements and tearing and exiting

100
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,480
objects should be the same on both sides of the scene so it can avoid the scene being unbalanced.

101
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,650
The next method is on fold, meaning opening, which shows opening or folding a paper.

102
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,120
As you can see, combining it by lines makes our work much more beautiful for creating this kind of

103
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,150
logo animation.

104
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:27,420
You can make your layer 3D and rotate them in X, y, and z axis.

105
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,840
With this method, you can create this kind of animation to.

106
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,710
The next method is 3D.

107
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,670
As you know, Aftereffect is not a 3D software, but yet it has good tools for making 3D like making

108
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,840
layers, 3D giving volume to the shapes and texts, creating shadow and light in 3D space.

109
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,110
If you set your cursor in the Engine and Cinema 40.

110
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,860
For example, these kinds of samples in which Lego components come into the scene and form the logo.

111
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:06,430
We can call them three logo animations, which are so popular in the past but now are unfashionable

112
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,230
and are not used anymore.

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,160
If you wanted to do a little more professional works, you can use the Elements three D plugin, which

114
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,770
has good abilities in animate and creating beautiful materials for 3D objects.

115
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,680
If you want to know all the abilities of this plugin is better to check out its creator website video

116
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,340
copilot and then watch the tutorial videos.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,470
If you are more interested in making 3D animations, my opinion for you is to learn the Cinema 4D software

118
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,650
so you don't have after effects limits and your logo animations and anything else you want to create.

119
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,960
3D can be made faster and simpler with the software's professional tools.

120
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,890
The next method is retrospective, meaning take a look at the past.

121
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,820
The way that we create this kind of animation is so simple it is just enough to animate your logo's

122
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
texture and tissues.

123
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,700
So you can have this kind of result regularly.

124
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,780
This kind of animation is used for old companies which are willing to show their experience and knowledge

125
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,370
in their work field.

126
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,520
Pay attention that this technique shouldn't be used everywhere.

127
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,280
And as I said, this method usually shows the experience and the oldness of something.

128
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,410
Therefore, there is no need to use it always, especially when a brand wants to express itself being

129
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,750
modern and its vision to the future.

130
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,740
The next method is using character or some parts of it like face and or in logo animations.

131
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,940
The properties of this method are that it shows more life and our logo animation makes better contact

132
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,290
with our audience.

133
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,790
Usually being a character in logo shows a connection between the logo and the brand, or for expressing

134
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,660
the brand's work.

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Feel better for creating this kind of animation.

136
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,690
We should have some pieces of information about characters make different poses and the way of animating

137
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,470
the different components of our character.

138
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,960
So eventually, with a little bit of help of creativity and different tools we have in this field get

139
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,220
a good result.

140
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:27,060
Maybe you think that this method is too hard and you don't want to go for it, but with a little learning

141
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,980
and practicing, it can create much more professional logo animations.

142
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,400
And after creating these animations, you're going to feel more confident and you will understand that

143
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,450
there is nothing that you can't do and other methods get much easier for you to do, and in the end

144
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,910
you will see that it is worth a try.

145
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,860
Sometimes you have to work with the typography logo that doesn't have any kind of icon or element graphic.

146
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,680
In these situations for getting a good result.

147
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,510
You can use your creativity.

148
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,580
Some tools which we talk about like line animation, glitch and other methods.

149
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,800
That's why I don't repeat them again.

150
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,200
The next method is animation Liquid, which is one of the most attractive methods to create logo animations,

151
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,740
and it is usable variously in different places.

152
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,890
For making liquid animation.

153
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,430
You can use the blur effect combining by the match of care.

154
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,630
This combination causes the objects to be shiny and flowing.

155
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,440
And the objects themselves can be created by 3D stroke or a particular effect.

156
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,430
And eventually, for creating splashes, we use a frame by frame animation to reach a great result.

157
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,750
Another log animation kind is intensive reveal.

158
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,200
This kind of animation is created by beak shapes, which further will be transformed into the logo.

159
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,890
This technique is frequently used in logos with small details like the logos you see now.

160
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:19,730
This method is going to be really useful when you want to use your log animation as the intro video.

161
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,730
For this method, you can combine different techniques together, but don't use more than three effects

162
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,900
at the same time.

163
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,170
And don't create your animation too long because watching some shapes which are frequently transforming

164
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,340
to another shapes more than 10 seconds is not so appealing.

165
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,430
After we got familiar with all the methods and different kinds of logo animations, it's better to talk

166
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:50,640
about giving sense to our animation that how we can make our animation meaningful and to understand

167
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,440
the concept to our audience.

168
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,150
There are two ways for giving sense to our animation generally.

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,910
The first one is abstraction, and the second one is sense.

170
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,930
The first method, which is so simple as its name implies, is abstraction animations, meaning creating

171
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,800
an animation by graphics elements and brand style, animate it the way you want and show it, because

172
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,710
this kind of animation doesn't say anything special, and it's enough for it to look attractive because

173
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,940
it's abstraction.

174
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,750
In the second method, which is sans your logo, an animation should express something about the brand

175
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,520
or the brand's products or its customers and explain about them.

176
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,720
There are different ways to make our logo animation meaningful.

177
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:47,010
The first way is to play a little bit with the logo or company's name because companies name explains

178
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,580
good descriptions about the company itself playing by name or logo and showing the company's activity

179
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,390
by objects.

180
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,110
Animation helps us to demonstrate the company's goal.

181
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,970
The next method is using morphing meaning showing what a company does by shapes, icons and effects.

182
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,190
You should pay attention that everything we use should be coordinated with the logo style animation

183
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,030
kind.

184
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,810
For example, if the logo has a smooth corners, we should try to use smooth corners in designing the

185
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,870
shapes we are adding to the logo animation.

186
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:31,020
Not only does this make the animation more beautiful, but makes our job much easier and more fun animating

187
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,130
the shapes and causes our animation to be more appealing.

188
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,670
The third method that we can make our animation meaningful with is animating the characters in the logo

189
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,480
itself.

190
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,580
Usually the characters using the logo are relevant to the company and its activities.

191
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,950
But yet you can do two things in animating the Lego characters.

192
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,920
The first thing you can do is to create a normal activity for your character, like flying for a bird,

193
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,020
because normal activity for bird is flying.

194
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,260
The second thing you can do is to animate your character as it does an activity which is related to

195
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,020
the company.

196
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,610
Like and are you looking around and looking for something?

197
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:24,270
And this animation is completely suitable for the researcher companies which are looking for new things.

198
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,770
The important point about logo animations that should be always considered is you are making logo animation.

199
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,390
So don't let it be too long and transform into a short film.

200
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,020
The last thing we should talk about is the animation from a technical point of view.

201
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,940
The logo animation should have an entrance at first.

202
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,120
It shouldn't be in the scene from the first, but it should form step by step.

203
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,910
Then the logo got formed.

204
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,830
If it is not going to be a loop, it should have an exit stage.

205
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:07,180
Meaning the logo after got completely formed again starts to end the animation and fades from the scene.

206
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,990
And if it is going to be looped, the first and the last part of the loop shouldn't be obvious.

207
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,920
Good luck.
