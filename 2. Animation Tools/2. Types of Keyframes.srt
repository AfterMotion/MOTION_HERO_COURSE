1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,440
In this lesson, we want to talk about different kinds of keyframes.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,790
Keyframes are categorized according to their speed.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,320
Here I have made four circles in different colors and made the same animation for them.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,390
So after we apply these different keyframes on them, we notice the difference between them.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,190
OK, The first kind is linear.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,700
As you see, it has a diamond shape.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,380
It means the speed of the animation is constant and linear all along.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:39,030
If I select the keyframes and go to 'graph editor' you see here this line is representing the speed of

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,420
animation, which is linear and straight.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,870
And if I keep my pointer on the first keyframe, you see the speed of the animation in the beginning

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:57,180
is on 1128 pixels per second, and this speed is kept all along to the end without increasing or decreasing.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,080
As I explained before, by these dots and equal space between them, you can understand that the animation

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,390
of this circle is linear and its speed is the same during the animation.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,910
Well, I go back to the key frames.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,210
The second type of keyframe is 'easy ease in'.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,510
This means the speed of the animation is high at the beginning and it slows down along the path.

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,330
Well, I select key frames for this layer.

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,990
I can press shift F9 or right click on the keyframes and from Keyframe Assistant, click on easy ease in.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,090
And as you see keyframe shapes changes to the right arrow, and also from the dots, you can understand

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,770
the animation speed is high at the beginning and at the end, because of the high density of the dots,

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,460
the speed has decreased.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,290
I play it now

23
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,880
As you see at the beginning, this circle goes beyond the last circle, which is linear, but at the

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,250
end they stop at the same time.

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,780
And this means at the end, the animation speed has decreased.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,630
I select Keyframes and Inter graph editor.

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,400
As you see, speed line of the animation is not linear.

28
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,280
In the beginning, the speed of the animation increases to 1500, but then as it progresses, the animation

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,150
speed is decreased and falls down to zero at the end.

30
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,500
Well, I go to the third type of keyframe easy ease out.

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,710
Its hotkey is Ctrl + shift + F9.

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,920
This one is the opposite of the previous type.

33
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:42,110
It means at the beginning animation speed is low and the more we progress it increases, I select keyframes

34
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,880
and click on easy ease out.

35
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,340
As you see it shape is opposite of the last one and it is an arrow to the left.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:56,000
If you pay attention, you see the density of the dots is higher at the beginning, meaning animation

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,890
speed is lower at the beginning and at the end speed is going to be higher.

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,260
I go to the graph editor.

39
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,560
You see it is the opposite of the previous case.

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,430
Low speed at the beginning and increasing over time.

41
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,190
Okay, let's go to the last one easy ease, with hotkey F9 in this type.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:22,140
The beginning and end of the animation is speed are low, but it's increased in the middle.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,300
I select keyframes, right click and easy ease them.

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,150
Now, if you pay attention here, the density is high.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,830
It is high here, too.

46
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,370
But compared to the beginning and the end, the density of the dots is lower here.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,770
And as you see, the shape of the keyframes is like an hourglass.

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,890
I select keyframes and go to the graph editor, as you see at the beginning.

49
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,120
The speed is zero.

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,380
It goes higher to this point and then it goes down to zero here.

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,880
If I play now, you can see, even though the duration of all these circles is the same because they

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,900
have different speeds, they also show different animations.

53
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,320
Now that we know four main types of keyframes, let's go to the next column to get familiar with other

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,330
types of keyframes as well.

55
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,390
The first one, as I explained, is easy ease.

56
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,150
At the beginning, speed is low.

57
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,520
It goes higher and then it decreases again and falls down to zero.

58
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:33,200
The next one is easy ease in, at the beginning speed is higher and at the end the speed decreases 

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,650
and the next one is easy ease out, which I explained before.

60
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,670
The next one is linear.

61
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,890
Another keyframe you need to know about is toggle hold.

62
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,870
This means our layer is in a frame in a specific place.

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,000
Then in the next frame is in another place.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And this happens without any movement.

65
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,340
To summarize, the hold animation happens in a jump, not by movement.

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,070
We just see in a moment.

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
It goes from here to there.

68
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:09,380
The next kind of keyframe is Rove across time, and it's for when you want to change the animation path and

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,800
apply single easy is to the whole keyframes.

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,810
Well, I select Rove across time keyframes, disable Rove across time, and I want to create single easy ease

71
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,330
for whole animation of this ball.

72
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,890
That means at the beginning of the animation speed is low here in the middle speed increases and at

73
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,290
the end speed decreases again.

74
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,280
So I select keyframes right click and easy ease them.

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,820
If you pay attention, you see what we intended to do Didn't happen correctly

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,210
 because the circle has a short pause where the keyframes are, and this makes

77
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,820
our animation doesn't run smoothly.

78
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,430
If I go to the graph editor, you see the speed of the animation is zero at the beginning.

79
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,590
Then increases, decreases again, increases again.

80
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,340
And so on

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,720
As you see, this makes the circle stop in the animation path.

82
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,790
To solve this problem I have to use Rove across time.

83
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,810
To do that, I select middle keyframes and enable Rove across time.

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,410
Now, if I go back to the graph editor, you see the keyframes as dots are spread in the speed graph

85
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,570
of the animation, and it is completely harmonic with the animation speed graph.

86
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,400
Now, if I play, you see that I have created the intended animation.

87
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,900
At the beginning.

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Speed is low.

89
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,510
It increases and at the end it decreases.

90
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,930
Although I have three key frames here, I was able to create single easy ease for the whole animation

91
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,930
without any pause 

92
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,710
I increse Its ease slightly.

93
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,380
From these dots, you can completely understand what animation speed is going to be.

94
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,370
The next type of keyframe is linear continuous.

95
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,740
Its hotkey is Ctrl + Click and it has a shape like a circle.

96
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,720
This kind of keyframe is for when you have middle keyframes.

97
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,130
Like this animation.

98
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,360
I select three key frames and easy ease them and play.

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,640
As you see, the layer has a little pause on the top.

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,740
And I want to remove this pause 

101
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,120
For this.

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,140
I go to graph editor and here to remove the pause I bring this keyframe higher to increase layer speed.

103
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,320
If I do this, you see, the keyframe becomes two points and I have to adjust them separately.

104
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,090
And this job takes time.

105
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,890
To prevent this, I just need to select this keyframe.

106
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,490
Hold down Ctrl and left Click on it 

107
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:08,390
as you see the keyframes change into a circle shape and now you can increase or decrease

108
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,080
the speed of your keyframe without it becoming two points.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,610
You can also do this in graph editor by right clicking on the keyframe, selecting keyframe velocity

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,920
and enabling the continuous option.

111
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,470
For now, I disable it.

112
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,030
You see, it becomes two points, and then I go to Velocity and enable it.

113
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,410
And you see two points of the keyframe move together.

114
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,760
Well, in this lesson, we got to know about different types of keyframes.

115
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,440
In the next lesson, we'll learn about different kinds of graphs and how to edit them.

116
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,370
Good luck.
