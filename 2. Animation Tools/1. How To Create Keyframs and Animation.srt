00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,160
In this lesson, we want to learn how to create keyframes and animations.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,510
For example, I want this plane to move and stop here.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,040
To do so, I select the plane layer and go to the transform.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,180
And to be able to give the plane this kind of movement.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,780
I have to use the position of the plane.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,460
Well, I want to give the plane a movement like this 

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,660
to animate this, the first thing to do is to create a keyframe.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,550
So to create a keyframe, you just have to click on the stopwatch beside the position property.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,480
As soon as I left click on the stopwatch, it turns blue and you see one keyframe is created here.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,780
You may ask why my keyframe is created here and nowhere else.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,520
It's because keyframes are created where the indicator is positioned.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,750
For example, if I want to create a keyframe for the scale, you see that the scale keyframe is created here,

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,600
 not at the beginning of the timeline.

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,360
That's why you have to be careful where the indicator is when you are creating the keyframes.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,860
Well, to delete the scale keyframe, all I need to do is to click on the stopwatch again or select

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
the keyframe and then press delete button.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,480
Well, now we have created a key frame for the position of the plane layer, but we don't have any animation.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,170
Why?

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,090
Because for creating an animation, we need at least two key frames for creating the second key frame.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,030
First, we need to bring the indicator to the intended time.

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,410
For example, I put it on second two and I want to create another keyframe for the position.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,120
To create another keyframe.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,580
I only have to click on this option.

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,430
As you see, another keyframe is created after I created the second keyframe.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,700
The left arrow of this option is activated.

26
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:06,850
It means you can go to the last keyframe by clicking on it or by clicking on the right arrow.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,020
You can go to the next keyframe, and by clicking on this option again, you can delete this keyframe

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,940
or create a new keyframe.

29
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,820
Well, now I have created the second keyframe.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,140
If I press the space button and play the animation again, you see, there is no motion for the plane

31
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,120
while we have two keyframes.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,220
The next thing to consider is that in animation we need to keyframes with two different values.

33
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,580
So in the first keyframe, the position value is this, and in the second keyframe is also the same

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,010
value, and there is no change.

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,930
And this is the reason why no changes happen to the plane when I play.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,780
To move the plane.

37
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,710
I go to the position, change its X and put it here.

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,520
You see, as I change its position, a line appears here that shows the movement direction of the layer.

39
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,020
And if I go to the beginning of the timeline and play the animation, you see that the plane moves.

40
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,980
I go to the second keyframe and delete it again.

41
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,800
The easier way to create your animation is not to create the second keyframe yourself.

42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,730
As soon as you select your layer and move it, you see a keyframe is created where the indicator is placed 

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,390
and the new position of your layer is saved.

44
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,230
I think until now you understand the meaning of the keyframe is storing the value of the position,

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,730
scale, rotation or any other property at a specific time.

46
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,160
You see in this time this value is stored for the position of this layer, and in this time this value is stored.

47
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,830
If you select the layer, you see some small dots in this direction line which are shown the layers

48
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,110
position in different frames.

49
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,600
You see in the first second.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
It is here on this dot.

51
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,410
If I go to the next frame.

52
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,430
So I press page down to go to the next frame.

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
You see it goes on the next dot.

54
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,620
If I press page down again, it goes on the next dot.

55
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,030
These dots are the position of the layer in different frames.

56
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,860
You can also change your animation path.

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,140
For this you only have to select the key frame.

58
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,790
Activate the pen tool, then left Click on the keyframes in the path 

59
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,020
and after appearing the handles, you can change your animation path easily.

60
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,850
For example, I set it like this and also make the handle visible in the beginning and set it like this.

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,910
And now if I play it, you see the plane is going to move along the path I have created.
