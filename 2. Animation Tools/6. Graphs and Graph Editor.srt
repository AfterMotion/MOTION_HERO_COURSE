1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,890
In this lesson, we want to talk about graphs and graph editor window.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,710
Generally, we have two kinds of graphs, value graph and speed graph.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,630
Well, as you see, I've created a simple animation for the position of this layer to enter graph editor

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,830
I just have to select these keyframes and activated this option, as soon as I activate this option,

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,260
you see some graphs shown here.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,230
Each of these is related to one dimension.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,260
The red graph is for the x position and the green one is for the y position of the layer.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,550
As you see here, the changes in value will be shown in the vertical axis and changes in time on the

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,960
horizontal axis.

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:54,220
For example, if I keep my pointer on the second key frame of the Y position, you see its value is

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,810
861 pixels and its time is one second ten.

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:06,340
But if I bring it here, you see its value is 308 pixels and its time is on zero.

13
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:13,510
The next thing to know is how to find out if these graphs are value graphs or speed graphs.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,710
For this, all I need to do is left click on this option.

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,820
And here, as you see, the 'edit value graph' is enabled.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,930
So I get that these graphs are for the value of the layer.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,270
Now I enable the 'edit value graph' option and as you can see, the graph is changed; 2 graphs became

18
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:41,530
one graph, and that's because the speed of the animation is not in two kinds and we have only one speed.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,690
As you see in the vertical axis, the speed value is shown and on the horizontal axis the time.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:56,500
And if I bring my pointer here, you see the speed of this keyframe in frame ten is 3318 pixels per second.

21
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:04,570
Well, I go back to the value graph so I can give more description of it, and then I will go for the speed graph.

22
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,550
You have to pay attention.

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:14,650
edit in the value graph is only possible if you have created animation for the uniaxial property such

24
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,930
as opacity and rotation.

25
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,550
But if you animate position and scale that are biaxial properties; by default you cannot edit your graphs.

26
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,900
And to edit this graphs you have to separate your property.

27
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,970
To do this, I right click on the property and select separate dimensions.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,530
After that you see that the X and Y position are separated.

29
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,930
And by using the pen tool, you can edit your graph; to edit the keyframe.

30
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,800
I hold on Ctrl and select the keyframe.

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,150
As you see, a handle is appeared for the keyframe, and by using this handle you can change the y position

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,250
of your layer.

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,280
And as you see these dots change as I make changes here.

34
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,780
I hold Alt and click on it so that the handle appears.

35
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:12,070
And to create a new keyframe, it just needs to left click with the pen tool on the graph line that you want.

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,020
And for four appear in the keyframe handles.

37
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,210
I hold down alt and click.

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,600
Well, as you see, the bouncing ball animation is a little bit fast.

39
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:15,210
To slow it down, I need to select keyframes, enable this option so a box like this appears.

40
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,570
And by using this box I can decrease the speed of the animation.

41
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,410
Let's see how it became.

42
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,160
A lot better.

43
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,620
Well, if I want to animate the X position of the Layer too, I need to put the X position here 

44
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,040
as I change the X position.

45
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,450
You see, the vertical value chart changes.

46
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:51,190
I select two values, bring X key frame to the end so that the X and Y positions stop together.

47
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,130
Here. I hold on shift and bring it higher so the ball moves more to the right.

48
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,500
Let's see how it is.

49
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,230
Okay, it's good animation, but if I want more control over my animation, like if I want it to have

50
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:20,500
a low speed at the beginning and high speed as it hits the ground and when it's in these peaks,

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,350
have a low speed and have a floating effect

52
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,460
I have to go to the speed graph and use this graph to have more control over the speed of the animation.

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,730
Well, I have created a new animation for this layer.

54
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,260
I have created three keyframes.

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,470
The first keyframe is here.

56
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,870
The second keyframe is at the highest point, and the third one is down here.

57
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,030
Let's go to the graph editor.

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,600
And if I want to make the ball a little bit floating when it's here and have a lower speed 

59
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,100
for this, we cannot use the value graph and I have to go to the speed graph.

60
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,590
Let me separate the property.

61
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,990
For this I use this option this time and disable this for now.

62
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:17,140
As you see, if I create a graph like this for the Y position, the animation completely falls apart.

63
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,030
And that's because the value graph, unlike the speed graph, affects the animation path directly.

64
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,580
I go back to the first state and enter the speed graph.

65
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,790
I want the speed of the ball to decrease around here, let me play it and see the animation.

66
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,000
As you see, it's completely linear and it's not natural.

67
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, I select the middle keyframe and make it easy so that the animation speed falls down to zero here.

68
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,820
As you see, the speed is zero Here 

69
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:57,090
it is 2662 here and here is 2800.

70
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,970
I play it again to see how it goes.

71
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,550
Let me trim the work area here.

72
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,300
As you see, a little pause is created here.

73
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,330
It happens because as you see, the speed graph is zero here, but it shouldn't be like this.

74
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,970
I want the speed to decrease around here, not to fall completely to zero and stop.

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,810
For this I bring the key frame up to prevent it from splitting into two points.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,640
I right click on the key frame, then select keyframe velocity and enable continuous.

77
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:39,800
Then I hold down shift and bring it up so the animation speed doesn't go to zero here and the ball doesn't pause.

78
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,510
It got better to lower speed here.

79
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,090
I increase the length of these handles.

80
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,470
As you see, it's better now, to notice this better i select keyframes and increase distance between

81
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,990
them to decrease the animation speed.

82
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,720
To increase speed here.

83
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,710
I set this handle like this and here the same.

84
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,730
I increase the speed a little.

85
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,260
It got better a lot.

86
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,350
It's good to create the bounce return animation.

87
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,970
I hold down Alt key so that both handles change together, i select keyframes and go to the speed graph.

88
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,660
I trim the work area here.

89
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,650
To fit the window to the graphs.

90
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,270
I just need to click here so that the graphs fill the window completely.

91
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,470
Next important point is that sometimes when you increase these handles manually, it is possible that

92
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,550
the speed increases on this side more than another side, to make sure your animation speed is the same.

93
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,690
Or in other words, the size of the handles is the same.

94
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:41,300
You just have to double click on the key frame or right click and enter keyframe velocity and in incoming velocity.

95
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,090
You see the influence is on 91 and an outgoing velocity influence is on 96.

96
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,960
So the animation speed in these two parts is different.

97
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,580
Well, to make them the same, you can enter two equal values.

98
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,540
You see now your handles have the same length.

99
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,040
You can do the same here.

100
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,950
Double click on the key frame.

101
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
And enter the value you want.

102
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,940
So the handles have the same size.

103
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,440
Also, if I right click on this key frame and go to the key frame velocity, you see influence is on zero.

104
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,550
While if I right click here and go to the key frame velocity.

105
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,590
You see, the influence is not on zero and the speed is different on the two sides.

106
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,680
So I change it to zero and press OK

107
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,240
Now, if we look at the animation, we see the ball speed when going and coming back is the completely same.

108
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,490
To completely master the grapg editor window and work better with keyframes.

109
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,930
You need to know about these options too, the first option, as it's obvious from its icon, is for appearing

110
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,570
graphs of properties I have selected.

111
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,630
For example, I go to the value graph.

112
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,870
The first option is for appearing graphs of properties I have selected.

113
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,830
If I select this, you see the graphs disappear, and when I select the property they appear again.

114
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,750
And if I separate them, you see each of the graphs is shown separately.

115
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,140
The second option shows the animated properties of a layer and the next part.

116
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,450
The first option shows kinds of graphs automatically.

117
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,620
This means for the position, it shows the speed graph and for other properties

118
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,480
Value graph.

119
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,140
This option shows the value graph and this one speed graph.

120
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,830
And this option shows both graphs.

121
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,930
These options are obvious from their name.

122
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,260
It is for showing waveforms of the sound layers.

123
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,310
This is for showing the beginning and end of the layers.

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,720
For example, if the layer ends here; in here you can see the end of the layer.

125
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,070
It shows this.

126
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,870
This option shows the description of any keyframe you bring your pointer on it.

127
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:40,130
This option is to show your keyframes in a box when you select them so you can change the animation

128
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,300
speed easily.

129
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,110
With this one, you can synchronize the selected keyframe with the value or time of another key frame

130
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,890
and snap it.

131
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,950
This option is for auto zoom.

132
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,850
This option is for showing your graph completely in this panel.

133
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,510
This option is for showing the selected keyframe individually so you can work on it easily.

134
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,850
The next option is for separating dimensions, which I have already explained.

135
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,230
The next option shows the same option when you right click on a key frame.

136
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,610
The next option is for turning a key frame to toggle hold.

137
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,600
The next one is for linear.

138
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,510
The next one is for linear continuous.

139
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,990
For example, i select this key frame and enter key frame velocity, disable continuous.

140
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:40,480
Now, by selecting these two points of the key frame and selecting this option, make the key frame a linear Continuous.

141
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,900
These options are obviously to turn keyframes to "easy ease" "easy ease in" and "easy ease out".

142
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,710
Well, it's enough for now.

143
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:59,080
In the next lesson, we will start creating a simple animation to put into practice what we have learned so far.

144
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,160
Good luck.
