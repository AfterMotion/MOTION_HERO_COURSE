00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,470
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:09,000
In this lesson, I want to create a simple animation so you get familiar with previous content practically.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,490
I have opened after Fix and I want to create a new project.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,720
So I click on new project after the new project is created.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,560
For getting started, I have to create a new composition.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,250
I set my composition size at 1920 by 1080 and its frame rate at 25.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,230
Let the resolution be on full and I set the duration to 10 seconds and choose gray for the background color.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,180
I name it Click.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,850
Well, now I want to import the designs into after effects.

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,300
To do so, I double click on the project panel and import the intended file.

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,120
After this, as I said before, I want the layers to be imported as a composition.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,910
So I choose composition and I set the footage dimensions on layer size so I can easily select the layers in the preview.

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,480
I open click comp and I want to create a simple clicking animation; for transferring the layers to the

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,270
comp that I have created.

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,990
I choose layers and press Ctrl+X and here I press Ctrl+V.

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,450
Before I start animating, let me delete "Yes" and "No" layers.

17
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,530
I don't want this layer, so I put it here for now.

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,130
I want to create two buttons for Yes and No.

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,710
For this I use the rounded rectangle tool and here I make a button like this.

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,930
I enable its fill, change its stroke color same as this text color.

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,770
And set it's fill on the gradient.

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,630
And change its color to the same as this one.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,270
And set it's handles like this.

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,790
I increase its size a little bit and bring it here.

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,650
I set the stroke on 5, so it gets the size as other lines.

26
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,330
to center the anchor point of this layer.

27
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,950
we just select the layer.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,720
Hold down Ctrl and double click on the 'pan behind' tool.

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,890
To make a duplicate of this layer and put it here.

30
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,000
I need to select the layer and press Ctrl+D.

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,850
I hold down, shift and drag the layer to this side so it only moves on the x axis.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,990
I delete this layer.

33
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,580
After that, I want to create a Yes text here and a No here.

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,800
I go for the text tool and write a yes here.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,830
I go to the character panel, change its color to this text color, and as the text layer is selected,

36
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:10,570
I go to the paragraph panel and select the center text so that the anchor point transferred to the center of the layer.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,160
Again, I go back to the character panel and decrease the size.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,840
I put it on 80, i select the layer, press Ctrl+D to make a duplicate of this layer and bring it here

39
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,700
and write No.

40
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,510
I think it's better to reduce these text mass

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,230
Let's go for animating.

42
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,720
First, i select the pointer.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,420
And to put its anchor point here, I use the pan behind tool and bring it here.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,540
In the beginning, I put it out of the scene.

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,610
I select the mouse layer, open its position and create a keyframe for it.

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,030
I go to second 1; to make the second keyframe

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,290
I bring the pointer on the Yes button.

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,680
And to put the pointer on the button, I put it on top of the layers.

49
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,490
I want it to stay here for 20 frames 

50
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:15,440
for this I hold down shift and press "page down" twice, so I go 20 frames forward.

51
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,790
Then I want to copy and paste this keyframe here.

52
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:26,100
So I select this key frame and press Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V to copy and paste the key frame here.

53
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,990
And if you watch the animation, we see the pointer move and stop on the yes button.

54
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,250
And in this time span, the pointer doesn't have any movement.

55
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,700
I go to second 3 and drag it out of the scene.

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,520
OK, After the pointer got here, I want it to click on this button.

57
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,500
For this.

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:02,720
I put the indicator here, select the mouse layer and press Shift+S so the scale property of the mouse appears too.

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,130
I create a key frame here for scale; 3 frames forward and set the scale on 80.

60
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,020
Again, 5 frames forward and set it on 100.

61
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,900
Let's see how it looks.

62
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,540
Okay, it is good For now.

63
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,590
Let's animate the yes button, i select the yes button, open its scale and create a keyframe for it.

64
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,870
Then I go to the frame where my printer shrinks and reduce button size too.

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,470
I put it on 90.

66
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,510
And again here on 100.

67
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,310
I just bring this keyframe 2 frames forward so it gets a different animation than the pointer animation.

68
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,120
Let's see how it is.

69
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,110
It's good for now.

70
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,610
Well, let's move on to shrinking the Yes layer

71
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,610
to minify the Yes layer.

72
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,020
I don't need to create keyframes for this scale of this layer.

73
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:21,650
I just have to parent the layer with the pick whip tool to the button layer so that the yes layer obeys the button layer in all transform properties.

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Let's have a look and see how it is now.

75
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,080
As you see, the Yes layer is also magnifying.

76
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:37,550
I select the bottom layer; press U key so only keyframes are visible and values without keyframes get hidden.

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,910
After that, I have to adjust the speed of the animation.

78
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I want the pointer to have a high speed at the beginning and slow down as it approaches the Yes button.

79
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,820
For this, i select this key frame and make it easy ease.

80
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,810
I go to the graph editor to slow it down even more.

81
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,590
I drag this handle and reduce its speed when it approaches the Yes button.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,670
Let's see.

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,860
And I do the opposite here.

84
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,980
I want it to be slow at the beginning and at the end have a higher speed.

85
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,480
So i select this key frame and make it easy.

86
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,220
I go to the graph editor and decrease its speed here.

87
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,810
Let's see how it is.

88
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,730
It's good; also to improve the scale keyframes.

89
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,950
I select them and make them easy.

90
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,070
Let's have another look and see how it is.

91
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,010
The speed of the pointer exiting is low a bit.

92
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,280
That's why I bring this keyframe here so it goes faster.

93
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,170
Again.

94
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,820
Let's see how it looks.

95
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,870
Much better.

96
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,370
The animation is good, but this linear movement doesn't look that interesting; to improve this linear movement.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,280
All I need to do is select the mouse layer.

98
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,080
Select the pen tool.

99
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,570
Then click and drag from this point.

100
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:27,920
As I do this, a handle is created here and by that you can control the path of the pointer movement.

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,510
I set it like this.

102
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,730
And at the end Like this.

103
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,710
As you see now, the path of the pointer has a curve and lost its linear bad movement.

104
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,980
The next thing to do is to change the color of the yes and no buttons when the pointer goes over them.

105
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,820
To do that, I go to the frame where the mouse has not yet been placed on the button, which is this frame.

106
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,510
I select the No button and go to the effects Control

107
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,840
from the Effects and Presets panel.

108
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,030
I add the Tint effect to it.

109
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,500
And said its amount to 50.

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,390
I create a keyframe for amount, select layer 2 and press U so the keyframe can be visible in the timeline

111
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,810
in the next frame that the pointer goes on the No button.

112
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,100
I set this on zero so that the Tint effect gets ineffective.

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,070
I go forward, here that the pointer exits the no button area.

114
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,950
Again, the No button must return to the previous state.

115
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,590
So I go back to the previous frame.

116
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,240
Copy this keyframe.

117
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,930
Then in the next frame I copy the initial Tint keyframe here; so that it goes back to this state.

118
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,790
I must do the same for the Yes button.

119
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,230
To do this easier, I just need to copy these keyframes.

120
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,970
And in the frame where the pointer has not yet gotten to the yes area.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,230
Meaning, Exactly here

122
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,930
i select the layer and press Ctrl+V

123
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,760
As you see, the keyframes are placed here.

124
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,400
I press U key to see the keyframes.

125
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,680
To prevent the Yes button color change early to its original color.

126
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,950
I select these key frames and take them far away.

127
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,490
After the pointer clicks and leaves the bottom area.

128
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,450
I put the keyframes here.

129
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,330
Let's have a look at the animation and see how it is.

130
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:45,620
As you can see, when the pointer goes on the buttons, it changes color and clicks and it goes out of the scene.

131
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,870
Well, it's good.

132
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,920
Good luck.
