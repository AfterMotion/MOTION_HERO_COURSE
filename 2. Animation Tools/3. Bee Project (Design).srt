1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,170
And this is I'll be working on a project from scratch to finish so you can better understand the process

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,120
of creating an animation.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,470
In this part I'll be using the shape tool for designing, and also you'll find a brief introduction

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,100
to this tool and how to use it, because in the later lessons there will be a dedicated chapter about

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,050
shapes, their modifiers and how to create animations using them.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,050
As I explained before, the first thing that I need to do is create a new composition.

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,300
So I create a composition for the savings of the comp.

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:48,460
I use the presets I choose HD 1920 by 1080 and I said the duration of the comp to 30 seconds and I set

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,440
the background color to gray.

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,430
I hit okay.

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:59,140
After that, I want to use this reference and create this be using the shape tool to do so.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,620
I like the layer so it won't be selected and moved.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,890
Isolate the shape to.

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,830
And I thought designing this.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,060
I began the designing process by clicking here and then dragging as I drag.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,610
You can see the two handles appear with which you can control the curve of the path.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,440
If I hold shift and drag, you can see that the handles will be in fixed, horizontal, vertical and

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,850
diagonal lines.

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,760
So I make it straight like this.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,270
The next point would be here I clicked and drag, so the shape matches the reference flawlessly.

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,250
For now.

22
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:52,020
I don't need this truck, so I disable it so that I can see the path and design the shape more precisely.

23
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,230
I create the next point here and track.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,780
I continue like this for now, and then I come back and fix these parts later.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,570
I create another point here?

26
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,870
Then I click on the first point again.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,800
So the path would be closed for these parts where the path doesn't match their friends.

28
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,560
I have to fix the handles for them.

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,960
As you see, if I move one of the handles, the other one moves as well and I don't want this.

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,910
So to adjust one of the handles I hold alter and change one handle.

31
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay, I have to fix this Part two.

32
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,770
I hold on and match the path with the reference.

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,020
I want to rename the layer so I selected and hit enter and I type body.

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,750
I click on the stroke and select solid color so its stroke will be enabled.

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,610
I make the straw color brown.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,290
And I said it switch to five pixels.

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,980
I click on the field, select solid color and hit the okay.

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,930
And to change the field color, I hide the layer for now.

39
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,570
I click on the field color and choose the color of the reference.

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,690
Now, if I show the layer, you can see that the film color matches the reference.

41
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,760
To see the way you're better, I swallow the layer so you can only see this layer.

42
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,270
I hide the body layer.

43
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,430
Now let's work on creating this part to create this part much faster and easier.

44
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,640
I duplicate the body layer to do that, isolate the layer and heat control.

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,250
I name the layer line.

46
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,100
And isolate the pen tool and create one point for the shape right here.

47
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,160
I create another point here?

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,390
Another point here and a point over here.

49
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,280
After that, I swallow the layer so I can work on it better.

50
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:32,330
Then I have to isolate the other points for that, isolate one point and hold onto and select the point

51
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,470
that I don't need.

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,390
And I hit the delete key.

53
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,140
I don't want this point either, so I delete it as well.

54
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,390
After that I don't want it struck, so I disable it.

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,550
I make the reference visible.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,230
I hide the line layer for now so I can match the path with the reference better.

57
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,070
I hold all two and try to match it with the reference.

58
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,000
Again, I hold alt and try to do that.

59
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,310
I do the same for these points as well.

60
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,340
I make both layers visible and I make the line color brown.

61
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,160
Let me hide your reference so I can see how much we have progressed.

62
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,370
Now let's work on this thing part.

63
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,940
I just have to create a triangle.

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,430
I put it below the body layer and I name it this thing.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,540
For the eyes.

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,190
I use the lips tool.

67
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,320
I come here in the center of the circle, I hold control shift and start driving.

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,780
So it starts from the center and it remains symmetrical.

69
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:07,170
And for the anchor point to move to the center of the shape, isolate the layer, hold control and double

70
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,300
click on the pen behind to.

71
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
I rename it.

72
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,940
I duplicate the layer and rename it again.

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,170
For the you're not to move around and in unwanted directions, just hold shift and drag.

74
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,710
So it would only move alongside the x axis.

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,900
Let's take a look at it again.

76
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,080
Then I create the cheeks.

77
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,630
For that I just have to duplicate this layer and move it over here.

78
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,570
To scale up the layer.

79
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,850
I just have to use these points.

80
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,240
I hold shifts so as not to disturb its proportion.

81
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,850
I changed color like the reference.

82
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,440
I duplicate it and move it here.

83
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,870
Let's work on the mouth part.

84
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,120
For that.

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,620
I use the pen tool.

86
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,500
I create a point like this here.

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,230
And here.

88
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,100
Like this.

89
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,730
I disable its feel.

90
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,500
An enabling stroke.

91
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,840
I swallowed the layer.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,390
As you can see, these parts aren't around to round them up.

93
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,800
Just like the reference.

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,340
I have to go to the shape layer in contents.

95
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,350
I open the shape.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,530
In a stroke section.

97
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,990
I set the line cap to round cap.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,680
And now these parts are around and about the settings.

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,630
Don't worry, because I've explained all these settings in the Shape chapter.

100
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,870
Well, let's take a look at the layers we've created so far.

101
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,150
It looks all right.

102
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,580
Let me rename this layer to.

103
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,580
Then I'm going to create the antennas for that.

104
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,900
I use the pen tool.

105
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,880
I renamed the layer.

106
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,130
As delayed and isolated.

107
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,400
I create this circle so that both of the shames would place in one layer.

108
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,320
I come to the center of the circle and by holding control shift and dragging, I create the circle.

109
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,400
I disable it.

110
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,270
Stroke.

111
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,930
And enable its feel and I change its color like the reference.

112
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,710
To fix its size.

113
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,240
I make it smaller.

114
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,350
I hold shifts so as not to disturb its proportion.

115
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:23,820
I have to place its anchor point here because I want to rotate it from here to make the other antenna.

116
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,830
I duplicate this layer and put it here and rotate it.

117
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,490
Then I'm going to create the wings.

118
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,500
For that.

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,070
The easiest way would be to create a circle here.

120
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,750
I rename it.

121
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,800
Note that when you use these tools to create your shape, you won't have any control over the points.

122
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,920
As you can see, if I want to change any point, I can do that.

123
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,550
And the only control you have is changing its size and position.

124
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:12,120
But if you want to have control of its path and points, you just have to right click on the Leap's

125
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,880
path and convert it to a busier path.

126
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,570
After doing so, if you hover over the points using the pen tool, the icon of the tool changes and

127
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,780
now you can freely change the path for that, isolate one point and hit control.

128
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,990
A So all of the points would be selected and then I hit control tw.

129
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:39,450
So this tool appears and now I can transform, rotate and change the shape however I want.

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,450
Then I rotate the shape in a way that this point would be aligned with the connection point of the wing

131
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,320
to the body.

132
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,290
Then I pick up the pen tool again, hold alt and click here.

133
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,060
So all points would be select and I select this point and move it here.

134
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,000
And now I adjusted like this.

135
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
Isolate the shape, change its true color.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,180
And I changed the field color like the reference.

137
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,070
And I place the anchor point over here.

138
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,530
This layer should be placed below the antennas.

139
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,020
I duplicate the layer and move it below the body.

140
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,640
I rotated like that.

141
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,000
And I slightly move it to the right.

142
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,790
Let me hide your reference and I make the other layers visible.

143
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,970
Well, I create a background as well.

144
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,220
Rename it.

145
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,680
And I place it below the other layers.

146
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,780
And then I have to create a shadow for this.

147
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,760
For it to be exactly in the center.

148
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,170
I enable Title Action save.

149
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,480
And then I hold control and create a shadow for it.

150
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,740
I disable it strong and make the film color brown.

151
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,110
I name it Shadow.

152
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,600
And I put it below.

153
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,800
I disable title action save.

154
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,060
I place its anchor point in the center and decrease its opacity a little.

155
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,530
Well, our design is quite ready.

156
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
In the next part, I'll begin animating the speed.

157
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,060
So I'll see you there.
