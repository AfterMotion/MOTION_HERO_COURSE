1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,870
As you know, I designed this be in the previous video.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,740
Now I want to animate it to do that first thing.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,750
First, I want to animate the body of the body.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,820
First of all, I place its anchor point in the center of it.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,140
I open the position of the layer by hitting the key.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,060
I create a keyframe for it.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,400
I zoom in a bit.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,720
It's shift page down so I got and frames forward.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,200
And I moved the body up a little bit.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,570
As you can see, once I move the body of the B, the other layers don't move alongside it all at once,

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,810
all of them to move.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,730
So for this to happen.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:52,610
I move back to the beginning of the timeline where all of the layers are intact and in one place, and

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,350
I select every layer.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,480
And by the pickup I parent them to the body layer.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,770
Now, if you notice, once the body moves up, every other layer moves as well.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,360
I hit shift pitch down and I moved ten frames forward and now I want to copy and paste the first keyframe

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,500
here, isolate the keyframe copy and paste it here.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,010
And then I make the keyframes easy.

20
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,640
As you can see, I made such a movement for the B.

21
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,530
I want my B to constantly go up and down.

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,520
To do so.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,240
I can select all the keyframes and copy and paste them frequently, which is a time consuming method

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,470
and unprofessional.

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:57,040
Because if you need to change the animation later, you have to change all the keyframes to get rid

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,410
of this repetition.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,140
I have to look the value of the position for that I hold onto and left click on the stopwatch of the

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,920
position.

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,320
I click on this arrow icon and in property.

30
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,160
I click and loop out cycle.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,760
After that, there will be an expression in the expression box which makes the animation loop continuously.

32
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,440
Okay, I click over here, so the expression would be applied.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,110
Now, if I play, you can see the B constantly goes up and down.

34
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,880
Let me make the scene fit.

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,780
Now let's work on animating the wings.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,700
Isolate the wings.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,440
By hitting the R I open the rotation, I create the keyframe for them.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,780
I go two frames forward.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,930
I rotate the wing downwards.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,830
And the other one as well.

41
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,550
I decrease the opacity of the wings.

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,190
For that I select the layers I see and set their opacity to 75.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,070
Again, I select the wing layers and reduce the keyframes which show up.

44
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,290
I move two frames forward.

45
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,410
And they want to copy and paste the initial keyframes here.

46
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,770
If I choose the keyframes of two layers and hit control C then control E.

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,160
As you can see, the layers duplicate instead, which isn't what I wanted to copy the keyframes.

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Only I have to use a script, so I use the motion tools, the script which I have put in the resource

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,170
folder of the course.

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,460
You can find and use it and to install it you can go to the after effects installation folder.

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,090
For that right click on the After Effects icon.

52
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,890
Again, right click on the After Effects and choose properties.

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,640
Click on open file location.

54
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,670
Then go to the scripts folder and then scripts your panels.

55
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,250
And right here just pays whatever script you want.

56
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:35,260
For instance, I copied this script for the resource folder of the course and pasted it right here.

57
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,710
After that, just go to edit.

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,060
Preferences, General.

59
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,850
Right here in scripting and expressions.

60
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,210
Check these boxes and hit OC.

61
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,320
Then you can run the motion to the script in the Windows menu.

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,410
I close this and open it again just to show you all.

63
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,020
I hit this and it opens again.

64
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,270
And if it was floating, you can just drag it and hold in its name and place it wherever you want.

65
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,560
Now let's get back to the animation, isolate the keyframes and copy and paste them right here.

66
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,270
I use the clone option.

67
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,480
As you can see, only the keyframes got copied, not layers.

68
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,220
And then I make them easy is.

69
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,010
As you can see, it only moves its wings.

70
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,070
Wants to look the animation of the wings.

71
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,950
I can hold on and click on one of these stopwatches again from here.

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,870
Properly I choose Look out cycle.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,780
To do this easier, I right click on the property that has the expression and choose copy expression

74
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,440
only.

75
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,160
Then select the properties that you want to have this expression and it's control V.

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,250
Now, as you can see, the animation of the wings works perfectly.

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,400
So add motion blur to the animation of the wings.

78
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,290
You can select the wing layers and enable motion blur for them.

79
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,170
And then you have to enable this option too.

80
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,760
If you pay attention, the animation of the wings has motion blur.

81
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,310
After that, let's work on the antennas.

82
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,900
For that isolate both antennas a heads are and open the rotation.

83
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,540
I create a keyframe for them here.

84
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,310
I rotate this little bank in the beginning, using the page down.

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,040
I move four frames forwards and I rotate this layer to the left, this one to.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,680
Again, four frames forwards and I copy and paste the initial keyframes here.

87
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,420
I make the keyframes easy, and because I've already copied the expression isolate these values and

88
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,530
hit control V.

89
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,110
Let's take a look at the animation.

90
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:24,850
All right.

91
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,270
It looks good for the animation of the antennas to look more natural and not for both of them to move

92
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,020
at the same time because the first antenna is affected by the wind sooner than the other one.

93
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,420
I can move these keyframes back a little bit.

94
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,800
After that, let's work on animating the ice.

95
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,090
To animate the eyes.

96
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,530
I open the scale.

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,940
I create a key frame for it.

98
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,670
Two frames ahead and I disable this chain icon so I can only change its y value.

99
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,300
And I said it to.

100
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,300
And I said it's X to 120, so it looks wider.

101
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,190
Again, three frames forwards.

102
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,010
I copy and paste this keyframe because I want its eye to be closed if it's right here.

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,430
And again, two frames ahead, I copy and paste the initial keyframe, so it's like it's opened.

104
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,930
I move the keyframes here, so the animation of the blinking occurs later.

105
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:55,190
And for the animation of the other, I just copy these keyframes and select this layer, then open scale.

106
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,990
I have to move the indicator to where the first keyframe is.

107
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,820
Isolate the scale and hit control V.

108
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,570
Now if I play.

109
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,710
You can see that both eyes blink together.

110
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,010
And to make it blink several times I could where I wanted to blink and by using the clone option and

111
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,550
selecting the keyframes.

112
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,040
I copy and paste the blinking animation to wherever I want.

113
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,010
Let's see how it turns out.

114
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,060
I want to trim the worker.

115
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,450
You are here for that.

116
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,150
I hate MN so it would get trimmed and after effects only renders this area.

117
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,800
And to loop the animation and make the starts and end of the animation invisible.

118
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,410
I just have to set the end of the work area where the bee goes down because it is down in the beginning.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,820
Let's take another look.

120
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,210
It looks great.

121
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,460
Now let's work on animating in the shadow.

122
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,690
For that I open the scale.

123
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,700
Isolate the body and hits you so I can see it's keyframes.

124
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,110
And according to these keyframes, I animate the shadow layer.

125
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,520
To do that, I create a keyframe for its scale.

126
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,340
I come here with the B goes up.

127
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,260
The shadow should be smaller.

128
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,620
So I set it to 80 and here it returns to its original size.

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,990
I make the keyframes easy and I copy and paste a look expression for it to.

130
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,510
Let's check it out.

131
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,580
See, as the beam moves up and down, the shadow gets small and big to.

132
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,100
And to show the movement and speed of the B better.

133
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,380
I can draw a couple of lines.

134
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,560
Enabling stroke.

135
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,340
I open its position and create a keyframe for it here.

136
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,870
I move it there.

137
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,810
I want its anchor point to be in the center of the layer four that I can use the motion to script,

138
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,940
isolate the layer and click on this option.

139
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,650
Ten frames forward.

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,460
Isolate the layer and hold shift so it moves straight.

141
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,620
And I move the layer over here.

142
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,480
I enable motion blur for it so it moves more naturally.

143
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,380
I duplicate this layer.

144
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,540
I hit you.

145
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,780
And I want the other layer to go up a little bit for that.

146
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,340
If I do it in the very beginning, you can see that the path gets crooked.

147
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:24,470
So for the whole animation to be changed, I must put the indicator on one of these keyframes, then

148
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,130
select both of the keyframes and then move the layer above.

149
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,880
I move this back a little bit so it won't be visible in the beginning.

150
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,930
I shorten this a little bit and delay animation is slightly.

151
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,690
Look for these lines to pass constantly.

152
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,880
I love these layers as well.

153
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,670
When I do that, they pass pretty fast to make it slower.

154
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,230
For example, ten frames after the second keyframe, I copy and paste the second frame.

155
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,080
And also for this layer.

156
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,000
Now they pass with a little bit of delay.

157
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,110
For this layer not to be on the B, I move it below everything else.

158
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,930
And they often it's an events so they won't seem repetitive.

159
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,740
I also make the lines thin a bit so they look more natural.

160
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,040
Look, it looks good to me.

161
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,600
The animation is done in the next part.

162
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,070
You will learn how I can render and export this animation.
