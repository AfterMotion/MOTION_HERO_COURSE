00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,150
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,650
In this lesson, I want to talk about interpolation.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:12,240
Interpolation is the process of creating intermediate frames between two key frames so that you don't

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,820
need to adjust the layer frame by frame.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,080
And as you create an animation with two key frames, interpolation comes in and creates movement between

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,700
these two key frames.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,470
These in between key frames once were created by traditional methods and manually, but now interpolation

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,390
does this automatically.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,280
For example, I created a keyframe for this layer here and another one here, and interpolation calculates

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,040
key frames for the frames between these two key frames and moves the layer like this.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,250
Well, what is the benefit of interpolation when you create two key frames for your animation, like

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,000
these two key frames, sometimes you need to adjust the values more accurately or edit your animation

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,480
path.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,530
Precisely.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,630
Interpolation helps you a lot.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,610
Overall, we have two interpolations in after effects, one temporal interpolation and two a spatial

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,410
interpolation to enter the interpolation section of the key frames.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,570
I just have to select the keyframe.

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,560
I want to change this interpolation right, click on it and click on Keyframe interpolation and enter

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,010
it.

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,620
As you see here, we have two kinds of interpolations temporal interpolation and a spatial interpolation.

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,400
Temporal interpolation, as it's written here effects the property have keyframe over time.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,020
Most usage of this interpolation is for unique axial properties like rotation, opacity or separated

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,890
position.

25
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,180
But the spatial interpolation as it's written here, affects the path of the layers, and obviously

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,390
a path exists when the position exists.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,870
So a spatial interpolation is more about layers, position and effects layers path.

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:15,390
First we start with a spatial interpolation, so we understand these options easier, and after that

29
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,760
we go to the temporal interpolation.

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,230
Well, the example I created here is four balls with the same animation speed.

31
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,710
They move together, they go up and down together.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,300
But the only difference is these layers path or their interpolation.

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,730
Isolate the first layer, select the middle keyframe, and I go to the keyframe interpolation.

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,070
As you see, a spatial interpolation of this layer is linear and the movement path of this layer is

35
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,850
linear.

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,850
If you look at the second layer, the moving path of this layer is like this.

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:01,180
And if I select the second keyframe and enter keyframe interpolation, you see that the spatial interpolation

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,290
is on busier.

39
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,320
Until now, you have noticed the difference between linear and busier.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,210
The linear sets the animation path in a linear manner and creates no handle for that key frame in the

41
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,840
path.

42
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,740
But busier curves the animation path in the intended key frame and creates two handles.

43
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,640
So we get to edit the animation path in any way we want.

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,110
The next step of a spatial interpolation.

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,290
As I have written, it is continuous busier.

46
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,040
This like the busier option as you see here, that the key frame is continuous busier, the animation

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,190
path is curved and two handles have been created for this key frame just like the last one.

48
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,280
But the difference between these two interpolation is that you cannot change one of them separately

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,950
in the continuous busier, and by changing the right handle, the left one changes with it.

50
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,750
And you don't have the same controls here as you have in busier, which is a feature in itself, or

51
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,770
when you don't want your animation paths to be broken.

52
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,030
The last type of a spatial interpolation is also busier.

53
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,780
This type of interpolation is almost the same as busier.

54
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,900
But here, if you change your animation path direction, you see the handles change according to the

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,050
angle of your animation path to keep their curve.

56
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,440
Let me change this one.

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,870
You see that what happened there is not like what is happening here.

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,090
The same is here as a change.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,810
This there is no effect on the past is before the keyframe.

60
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:49,010
But in order busier when the path changes according to the curve, the key frame handles also change.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,200
As I try to change the handles, it changes to continuous busier.

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,550
And now if you change this, you see it is not as it was before.

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,420
Now that we got familiar with this spatial interpolation, let's go for temporal interpolation.

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,530
To do so, isolate this keyframe of this layer.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,250
Go to the graph editor in the value graph.

66
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,150
Right click on the keyframe and go to the keyframe interpolation.

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,800
Temporal interpolation.

68
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,120
As I said before, this interpolation is usually applied for uni axial values.

69
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:31,740
To do so, I separate the position of this layer so its handles up here, isolate the middle keyframe,

70
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,420
enter keyframe interpolation and from temporal interpolation I click on linear you see as a selected

71
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,110
linear.

72
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,270
The value graph of the animation is set on linear and it is obvious here.

73
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,260
If I change this key frame, you will see that it is completely linear.

74
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,780
I go to the second option.

75
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,560
Busier.

76
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Busier acts exactly like this option.

77
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:04,490
But the difference is that the spatial interpolation effects the animation path, but here it affects

78
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,690
the value graph.

79
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,230
I change the handle.

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,220
You see, I can edit each of them separately.

81
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,260
Again isolate the key frame and turkey frame interpolation and choose continuous busier.

82
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:27,250
Continuous busier, as I said, here is for changing the handles together and making sure no breaks

83
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,640
happen in the graph.

84
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,650
I go to the next option a little bit easier.

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,020
As I said before, it is for when I change the graph.

86
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,540
The handles change according to the curve of the graph.

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,220
You see, when I drag it up in here, it sits lower and also we see its effect after the keyframe.

88
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,780
You see, when I drag it down, this side goes higher.

89
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,080
And when I bring it higher, this goes down.

90
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,090
The last option is hold, which is toggle hold.

91
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,710
That allows me to make my keyframe goes into all manner.

92
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,850
I also made this keyframe toggle hold.

93
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,670
As you can see, when I use toggle hold, the value of the key frame I put on toggle hold is applied

94
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,530
until the next keyframe.

95
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:29,270
It stays in place until here, and in the next keyframe it transfers to the next keyframe location.

96
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,960
If I want the same thing to happen here, I have to put these two keyframes on hold.

97
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,580
Option.

98
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,980
Well, in this lesson we learned about the concept of interpolation and its different kinds in aftereffects

99
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,490
and their effects on the path and value of the animation.

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,210
In the next chapter, I start creating basic animations that are essential for any animator to know

101
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,120
so you can create a tractive motion graphics.
