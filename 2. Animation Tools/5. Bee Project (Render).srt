1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,700
After I'm done with the animation to render it, I have to go to the composition menu and choose the

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,380
add to render queue option.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,970
After the render cue panel showed up here from the output module, I click here.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,020
Here you can choose the format of your clip.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,530
I choose Edge 264 in previous versions of After Effects.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,000
This option doesn't exist and you had to choose QuickTime and export your clip as a move file.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:42,180
However, in newer versions, the H 264 is available and you can easily export your animation as an

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,350
MP for file.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,270
Here you can choose your clip channel to be either RGV or Alpha.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,370
Alpha makes it black and white.

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,770
When you choose H 264, you don't have to change any settings.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,730
If you wanted to change the dimensions of your output, you can do that here.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,450
You can change the height and width here and here you can crop your output file.

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,440
But now I don't need this.

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,890
If you ever want to do that, it's better to do these things in your composition.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,250
These options are mostly for light weighted previews of your work, but in general you'd better use

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,470
the settings of the composition I hit.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:22,850
Okay.

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,230
I click on this option so I can choose where I want my render to be saved.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,630
After I named my final file, I hit save.

21
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,860
And then here I click on render.

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,380
Well, after rendering is done, you can click on this arrow and this address so it would show you where

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,880
your file is saved.

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,410
I right click on it.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,350
I go to its properties.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,990
As you can see, the size of the final render is 350 kilo points, which is pretty good.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,140
In the next lesson, you will get to know how to work with graphs and graph.

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,810
I'll see you there.
