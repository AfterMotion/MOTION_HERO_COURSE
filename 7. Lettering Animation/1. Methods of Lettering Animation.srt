00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,030
Hey, everyone, In this chapter, I want to talk about weathering animation.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,700
You must have seen such animations on the Internet.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,540
As you can see, weathering animation is quite intriguing.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,560
Well, it has very simple principles, but to achieve fascinating result, you need to have patience

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,720
and put a lot of time into it.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,270
Because the more details your animation have, the better your results will be.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,710
In this chapter, you will learn how to create a write in effect for the text, make a bouncy animation

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,460
for it, and how to add some details to the text.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,180
And after learning all of these and some principles that we have to follow in lettering animation,

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:53,890
I will work on an exercise and I'll create a leading animation project from start to end so we can use

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:01,030
what we learned on an actual project, not solely because these techniques are useful in rendering animation,

12
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,080
but also because you can use them in local animation as well.

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,460
Now let's get right into it.

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,170
The most important of slithering animation is preparing the letters.

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,030
So I import the file that I want to work on.

16
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,710
I put this file in the resources section so you guys can use it to.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,380
It's best to use vector files.

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,950
I can read this vector file into a shape.

19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,380
And delete the previous file.

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,600
Okay, so the first thing that I need to do is divide the letters of this text into separate parts.

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,430
I duplicate this layer.

22
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,820
You can use the mask for this job.

23
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:54,990
For doing so, I select the shape layer and then pick up the pencil to mask the shape.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,590
You have to enable this option after that eye mask, this leather.

25
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,680
A better approach would be to delete the parts I don't need.

26
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,110
For doing so, isolate the point, hold control and start dragging until I don't need it and I delete

27
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,500
them.

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,570
Let me hide the layer below.

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,130
For the anchor point to be in the center of the layer while the layer is selected, I hold control and

30
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,330
double click on the pen behind tool.

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,940
So I put the first leather in a separate layer, then I rename it.

32
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,970
So since this letter is complex, it needs to be cut into individual parts as well.

33
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,970
For example, this part will be separated.

34
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,520
The next one would be this part and the third one would be this part.

35
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,460
So I duplicate this layer twice.

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,950
I make the first layer solo.

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,670
I want to keep this part, so I need to delete the rest.

38
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,840
For the second one.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,870
I need to keep this part and delete the rest.

40
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,090
And finally, I have to cut the third one, which is this part.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,820
I stretched the first part so it would reach this section.

42
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:58,920
All right.

43
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,620
After I'm done cutting the first letter into different parts, it's time to animate it.

44
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,450
Generally, there are two ways for creating a write in effect for this letter.

45
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,350
The first approach would be using the pen tool and drawing a shape for the path of the animation.

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
Let me change its color so it would be obvious.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,950
I increased the stroke so it would cover the shape completely.

48
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,280
After that, I add a trim pass to the shape.

49
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,790
Since I want the animation to start from here, it has to be animated like this.

50
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,820
I set this thought 100 and create a keyframe.

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,260
Then after ten frames, I set the song to zero.

52
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,780
After doing so, I hide the path layer and slowly delete the first part.

53
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,260
Then I enable modes and say to alphabet.

54
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,450
If I move the indicator, You see, the right interface has been created.

55
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,590
The other way to do this that doesn't require us to create another layer is using the stroke effect.

56
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,750
For doing so.

57
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,690
Isolate the layer and use the pencil.

58
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,100
Then I switch to mask mode and create a mask for the shape.

59
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,860
After it's done, I hop on the effects control panel and add the smoke effect to the layer.

60
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,590
I recolor thread so it's visible.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,900
Then I increase the brush size so it would cover the whole shape.

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,620
I increase the hardness to 100.

63
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,070
I set the spacing to zero so the animation would be smoother.

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,990
And then I set the paint style to reveal original image.

65
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,050
After doing so, once I animate the sword and the end, as you can see, where there is a stroke, it's

66
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,760
visible, and where there is no stroke, it's not visible.

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,650
So for the animation to start from here, I create the keyframe for the start and move it right here.

68
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,760
Ten frames ahead.

69
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,440
I say to 100.

70
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,390
Now I need to work on the next part.

71
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,080
First things first, I need to make a path for its mask.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,290
All right.

73
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,840
After drawing the path, I just have to select the previous layer and copy this together.

74
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,350
Then at the beginning of the timeline, isolate this layer and press control V so it would create the

75
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,670
same animation effect just like the previous layer.

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,830
And since this one is a bit lengthy, I'll set the animation length so 20 frames.

77
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,860
Let me make it solo right here to fix the ride in animation.

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,540
I just have to change the path of the mask slightly.

79
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,990
It's fixed now.

80
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,010
I moved a layer right here.

81
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,830
And at last, it's time for this layer.

82
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,260
I enable the mask mode and create a mask for this layer to.

83
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,030
I copy the stroke effect and paste it for this layer as well.

84
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,080
It seems all right.

85
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:53,440
So far as you can see, I just simply created this animation to make it more dynamic.

86
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,130
I have to use a scale and rotation.

87
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,780
To do so, isolate the main layer and parent the other layers to this one.

88
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,780
I put its anchor point right here and make the scale and rotation visible.

89
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,380
Then I create keyframes for them and ten frames further on.

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,520
I create some other key frames for them.

91
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,550
Then isolate the first keyframes and set the Y value to a D.

92
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
And I say that this way.

93
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,970
I made the first cue frames eases.

94
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,650
After doing all of these, I add the bounce expression to it.

95
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,360
I enabled exploration of a scale and pace the bounce expression there.

96
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:49,620
However, I set the amplitude to 0.2 frequency to 1.5 and decay to two.

97
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,920
It's all good.

98
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,020
I copy the same expression and paste it for the rotation.

99
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,660
And make it overlap just a little bit.

100
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,330
Then I move these keyframes to the beginning of the timeline.

101
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,960
All right.

102
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,410
For this part, I have that bouncing effect.

103
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,200
I made this scale visible.

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,810
First I move its anchor point right here and create a keyframe for it.

105
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,240
Ten frames further, I increase the value of the scale and reverse the key frames.

106
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,670
And then I paste the bounce expression for it.

107
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,580
Let's see how it looks.

108
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,510
It looks better now.

109
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,230
It's more dynamic.

110
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,430
Took care of the letter.

111
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,990
I can use the benefit.

112
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,470
For this, I apply the benefit to the main layer.

113
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,800
Then I move the endpoint here and the third point right here so I can create such a look for it.

114
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,540
I create a key frame and press use.

115
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,290
I can see the key frame.

116
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,450
I move it right here in the beginning and in the end the pen should be zero.

117
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,690
And for the beginning, let me come here.

118
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,270
In the beginning it should look like this.

119
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,170
So I set it to -60 and move the keyframes right here.

120
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,360
Then I make it easy.

121
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,450
After doing so, I paste the bounce expression for the band as well.

122
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,460
Let's see how it looks.

123
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:46,940
And then to make it look a bit better, I move these bags so its animation would match the scale animation.

124
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,390
It's better now.

125
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,990
I can use the same effect for this part to.

126
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,420
To do.

127
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,880
So I come here and I'm parented.

128
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,070
Then I copied the band keyframes and paste them for this layer, and then I fixed the start and end

129
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,420
points of this layer.

130
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,150
Let's check it out.

131
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,650
I just need to make the animation a slightly faster.

132
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,930
And I decrease the band value to for the in the beginning.

133
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,490
And I move it back a little bit so it would match the whole animation well.

134
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:47,120
Another thing you can do to make it look prettier is to create multiple layers for your animation,

135
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,030
just like the example shown on the screen.

136
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,010
So what I'm going to do is to duplicate the first layer twice.

137
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,300
Then I renamed them so they would be recognizable.

138
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,160
And I change its color.

139
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,130
I apply the fill effect to it.

140
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,940
I promise you.

141
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,750
And I moved the stroke keyframe forward, so the animation would have different layers.

142
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,940
I do the same for this key frame.

143
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,640
And I recolor them.

144
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,530
As you can see, we can also make this kind of animation.

145
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,450
And to avoid this to happen, you can move this layer above the others.

146
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,350
You can do the same for the other layers as well if you want.

147
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,890
As of right now, I don't want to do that.

148
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,560
I just wanted to show you that we can do such things.

149
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,880
Well, we just learn how doing animation is done.

150
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,710
If I want to add decorative details and elements to our animation, what should I do?

151
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,020
For this I can use lines.

152
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,800
For example, I want to add a line that goes around here and create this letter over here.

153
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,680
For this I just have to use the pencil.

154
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,770
I draw a line in the center of the scene.

155
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,360
I want my line to go around like this.

156
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,880
And it should land here.

157
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,300
After I'm done drawing the line, I change its color to white.

158
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,900
And rename it.

159
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,380
Then I add a trim pass to it.

160
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,870
In the beginning, the start and end values are set to zero.

161
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,320
And after 20 frames, they should be set to 100.

162
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,290
And then I moved them like this.

163
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,600
So it would give this kind of look.

164
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,170
Something like this.

165
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,760
After that, under the stroke section, I changed the line cap to round cap.

166
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,330
So the start and finish of the line would be around.

167
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,800
And then in the taper section, I set the sod length to 100.

168
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
So it will look like this.

169
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,840
And here I create a keyframe for the start width and increase its value.

170
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,930
Isolate these three layers and move them forward.

171
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,340
So the animation of this line would be shown first, then the animation of the letter.

172
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,970
It goes around and comes here.

173
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,900
Well, to make it smoothly, I come here and set the start with seven.

174
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,870
And also I showed the path from here.

175
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,640
Let's see how it goes.

176
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,400
Okay, I move these layers back.

177
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,870
Entering this layer here.

178
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,670
I make this a little faster so that it would match the speed of the line.

179
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,290
And to make the animation look better, I create a keyframe for the start and end.

180
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,450
Then easy.

181
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,210
Ease them.

182
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,330
And I open the graph, then I decrease the speed of the line right here.

183
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,140
I set the keyframes to continuous so I can move the three points and out points up together and decrease

184
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,800
the speed.

185
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,690
Now.

186
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,740
Let's check it out.

187
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,370
It looks much better now, as you can see.

188
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,710
It pauses here for a bit and then goes there fast and creates the leather.

189
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,020
After doing that, I still can add more details to it.

190
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,400
For example, right here I create another spiral.

191
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,230
Apparent this layer to the main layer of the letter so it would move along with it and also for it to

192
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,650
be synchronized with the band animation, I just have to copy and paste the benefit for this layer as

193
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,130
well.

194
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,410
I also have to put the keyframes in their place.

195
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,630
It should be right here.

196
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,900
As you see, it's now sitting with the letter.

197
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,740
After doing so, it's time to animate it.

198
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,900
First of all, I set the line cap thrown cap under the taper.

199
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,210
I said the start and end to 15 so it would look like this.

200
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,070
I also increased the stroke width and set it to ten.

201
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,250
I add a trim pass to it, then I set the start and end to zero in the beginning.

202
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,960
20 frames further, I set both of them to 100.

203
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,860
And I overlap them, so it would create the animation.

204
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,790
I decrease it with just a little bit.

205
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,640
I said this is sort of the layer right here.

206
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,370
I think I need to make this slightly smaller.

207
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
Let's see what it looks like.

208
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,290
It looks all right.

209
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,100
We can also create a splash right here just to make it look even better.

210
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,940
I come here and create something like this.

211
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,900
To make the movement better.

212
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,020
I moved the layer back where the leather is starting.

213
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,150
Repairing the splash to this part of the letter.

214
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,690
I just did splash path again.

215
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,750
And to make it disappear smoothly, I need to create a keyframe for the width of the stroke.

216
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,240
I set it to zero in the end.

217
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,640
Isolate the keyframes and make them easy.

218
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,940
I open the graph editor and make the end smoother.

219
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,340
Let's see how it looks.

220
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,190
I decrease the speed of.

221
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,530
I can also duplicate this layer, change its path.

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,800
And decrease in size.

223
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,210
And change its animation.

224
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,700
Well, it's good so far.

225
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,620
And this video I talked about, the techniques and principles which you can use in animation.

226
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,940
You'll also learn how to make it look better and add more details.

227
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:48,480
And the next part, I'm going to animate this text completely so there wouldn't be any sort of problem

228
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,180
in animating the letters for you guys.

229
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,230
Good luck.
